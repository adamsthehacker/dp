                         If you don't have a relationship with a child yet, it is now time to get one. Thus, welcome to a brand new guide of the handbook, a guide that will thoroughly teach you how to find yourself a child for friendship, romance and sex.

                         There are so many children in this world, and there are so many ways to find them and get in touch with them, so this is actually much easier than most newcomers think.

                         <u>All</u> pedophiles can find themselves children, with enough patience and willingness. It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor, healthy or sick, tough or afraid, outgoing or shy, having your own home or living in the basement of your parents. Even homeless people and wheelchair users can find themselves children by reading through this guide. There are options for <u>everyone</u>, and I want everyone of you pedophiles to find yourself children. The word 'impossible' does simply not exist in this guide, and it never will.

                         The last chapter, after Hunting Season, will teach you how to most efficiently befriend and keep close friendships with the children whom you've found. However, the Hunting Season sub-guide will have an additional section about how to befriend children, especially related to outdoors hunting.
