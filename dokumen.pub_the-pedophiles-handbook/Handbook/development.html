                         All kids develop through their childhood, and they develop fast.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         During this development process, they go through some specific age stages; and each stage is very different from the others, in the way they think and behave.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There are also different advantages, disadvantages and limitations for each stage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In other words, when a child moves from one stage to another, the child will change a lot. But, it won't change that much while being inside a certain stage. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         These stages are very important for all pedophiles to learn, especially those who want to have sex with kids, as they all contain information that affect child love practice differently.

                         Within child psychology, there are 5 main age stages of child development that group children into specific groups:

                         Each of all these stages will be thoroughly gone through in details in this chapter, with subjects relevant for pedophiles.

                         It all begins with a scream, and a new human being is brought into existence in our mystical universe.

                         This human being will begin on a very special journey that we call the childhood, which will contain exploration and wisdom about life. And one of the most exciting explorations of life that this human being will go through, is the human sexuality.

                         This stage starts with a pre-stage called neonate, which lasts for about 4 weeks and is considered as the <b class="h">fragile stage</b>. During this stage, all babies are extremely fragile, especially their skin. Their skin can easily crack and bleed if not handled softly, even become permanently damaged if treated roughly.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         After these 4 weeks, the baby enters the infancy stage, which is all about basic development of primitive senses, like sight, hearing and touching. And it will quickly begin to observe its environment and bond with other humans, especially its primary guardian, usually as in mummy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         During the first 4 months, their skin will <u>remain</u> easily irritated. Any semen left on the skin may cause rashes. Even though these rashes are usually harmless and won't prove any sexual abuse, they will still be quite irritating and painful for the child.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Another important note for the first 4 months is the inability to swallow solid food. So, even though they are very good at sucking on things, which can make it tempting to give them your penis to suck on, any ejaculation of sperm into their mouths is considered as <u>very</u> dangerous during this period.
                         
                         <br />

                         After 4 months of age, it's usually safe to begin practicing sex with babies. Their skin is much less sensible to sperm, and they're beginning to swallow solid food, meaning that semen can be shot onto their skin <u>and</u> into their mouths.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Though, the rule of thumb among professional nepiophiles is to wait until they become at least 6 months of age before having any sex with them. It's good to have some margins, considering that all children develop a little bit differently from each other during this early infancy stage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The sucking mechanism of their mouths and grasp abilities of their hands become very hard around 6 months of age too, meaning that lots of fun can then be initiated. They're now perfectly able to hold bottles and suck them hard, so imagine switching a bottle for your erected penis, thus feeding them with semen instead of milk.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         During the 6-12 months period, their curiosity for new objects, and skill to handle them with their hands, will only increase. They will also be able to understand simple instructions. And all this creates a lot of nice opportunities for most nepiophiles, or any other person who's tempted to try having sex with the very youngest.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Speech is nonexistent at this whole stage, except for some vowel like noises that aren't recognizable at all. Thus, they will <u>not</u> be able to reveal any sexual play through any speech, neither through any behavior.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their mental capabilities are very sparse, so they will not be able to really understand anything during this whole stage, making them pretty much perfect play toys for horny males.

                         Infants are usually not known to be the most sexually active, at least not during their first 4 months of age. They are now going through a major development process of the most primitive and crucial life functions, thus most resources are dedicated to this exactly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         After about 4 months of age, they will suddenly become way more potentially sexually active. This has something to do with their increased motor skills, while also being very curios about new objects and things. As a part of this, they usually find their own genitalia accidentally when their genitalia is accessible, like during diaper change and bathing.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         How fast they discover their genitals, and how much interest they dedicate to that area, varies a lot from baby to baby. But, the average baby will nevertheless find this area as a very pleasant part of its body to touch and feel, thus some sort of masturbation usually occurs. With adult guidance however, things will become much more enjoyable a <u>lot</u> sooner.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Of course, with such limited awareness and intelligence, which is normal for all babies, they won't have an <u>intellectual</u> relationship to sex. It will only be about primitive and instinctive pleasure; which I guess works fine for most nepiophiles nevertheless.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         However primitive and limited their sexuality is, they will still enjoy sex enormously, and appreciate the excitement of exploring 'foreign objects'(!).
                         
                         <br />

                         Babies, girls especially, have often been seen masturbating themselves if being left alone to explore their bodies. Horrified parents, moms especially, have witnessed even young babies build up a breathtaking sexual lust, while touching themselves in a flimsy way, to finally release it through a seemingly delicious orgasm. Right there on the changing mat! And after the orgasm, the babies have seem to relax and become very calm, even less grumpy.

                         Babysex is considered as the safest possible way to practice pedophilia, or nepiophilia if you like, and is <u>highly</u> recommended for the newcomers as a great entry-level for sex practice with children; as long as you follow the earlier safety notes for physical treatment of infants.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Babies are primitive, immobile, lack speech and are capable of enjoying sex with even hard orgasms. So, none of you have any good excuses for not having sex with babies, whom initially are ready almost 24/7 for male sexual pleasure and satisfaction; well, at least when mommy looks away.
                         
                         <br />

                         Children within this stage are very orally aggressive too. According to the great Sigmund Freud, children will during this stage have their <b class="h">mouths</b> as their primarily erogenous zone. This means that they can become sexually aroused by stimulating their mouths through wet kissing or letting them suck on various 'wet objects'.

                         Welcome to the <u>cutest</u> stage of all childhood. We are talking about the very special toddlerhood, which is the natural continuation of the infancy stage.

                         This stage represents a huge explosion in both physical and psychological development. Not to mention, fine motor skills and an additional detonation of a very large bomb labeled: sexuality and horniness. This stage is probably the stage with the largest rate of development and changes of all the others, to both enjoyment and sadness among most parents, and to both pleasure and fear among most nepiophiles.

                         They are not chubby and bald little babies anymore, they are now becoming BIG babies with beautiful hair, beautiful faces, beautiful eyes, large and enticing mouths, fat little vaginas that become all wet, cute little penises that become all hard, and a bouncy bum that just begs for penetration along with those juicy mouths and vaginas.

                         And, a greater visible gender difference between the girls and boys will gradually appear throughout this stage.
                         
                         <br />

                         At the beginning of this stage, the children may appear some chubby. This is normal and called baby fat. They will loose this chubbiness as soon as they become more physically active during this first year, which will gradually turn their bodies from blobs of meat into a more human like shape.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         They will now become much more physically active, contrary to their baby stage. This is also the year most learn to walk. This usually results in restlessness, and that they get quickly bored by doing the same ting over a certain amount of time, which can become a challenge for nepiophiles during sex.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They will now enjoy looking at pictures, which can have some interesting results if they look at adult porn or child porn. That goes for videos and movies too.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         They will now begin to understand functional relationships, as in things that belong together, like the penis belongs to the vagina or the mouth. They also begin to imitate adult actions, as a part of their general learning. And all this make sexual play very interesting and rewarding.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their social intellect and behavior is also increased during the first year of this stage, as in appreciating adults with lots of hugging and kissing. Such intimacy is important to exploit and increase over time, as in sensual and erotic touching and kissing of toddlers, and do that a lot so the toddlers get used to it. This is an important investment for the future.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Tantrums are now very common. But even though they cry their eyes out, it doesn't mean that they are in any real pain or discomfort. And neither does it mean that they'll become traumatized in any way from it. This is <u>especially</u> important to know during sex, as tantrums and crying may also occur then. As long as they don't have any real reasons to cry, like being threatened or harmed, tantrums are <u>nothing</u> to worry about.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Probably the most <u>important</u> part of the whole toddlerhood is their speech, which begins for real during this period, but varies a lot from toddler to toddler.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         During their first year, they may know anything between 5 to 50 words. But, it's very rare for a 1 year old to put any of these words into any real sentences; they are usually limited to use single words with very weak and primitive connections.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Since an average 1 year old can't put words into sensible sentences, it can't really explain anything. And by further messing their vocabulary up a little bit, by renaming certain objects and rephrasing certain sentences, speech does rarely become a problem at this year in regards to sexual play, and having that play revealed later through their speech.

                         This is the age that professional nepiophiles officially refer to as the 'living doll stage', because this is <u>really</u> the cutest age of all childhood.
                         
                         <br />

                         The toddlers will only become more and more physical and active during this second year of toddlerhood. They will also get more and more restless and inpatient during activities that take a certain amount of time to complete. Thus, it can become a real challenge making love to 2 year olds.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, choosing the right time of the day may help some, like the parts of the day when the toddler is sleepy and tired. But, sleepy and tired toddlers are almost like unstable hand grenades of tantrums; they can easily go off, and suddenly you've got a little screaming and kicking doll to handle.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         They will now also increase their tantrums from just crying to actual physical aggression. So, they can now actually attack you physically and bite you, as angry little lions. Be careful!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Toddler tantrums usually peak during the mid part of this second year, so it can become a serious struggle making love to these ones. I've heard some really funny stories about angry toddlers who've bitten male penises and fingers when sex and tantrums have been combined. Luckily, this will decrease towards the end of this period. And, it will continue to decrease during the next and last year of toddlerhood.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their hand grip will become pretty hard and decent during this second period. It can become a great pleasure to have two strong little hands from a 2 year old jerking you off in the flimsiest way ever; as long as you manage to come before the toddler gets bored and wants to do something else(!).
                         
                         <br />

                         Unfortunately, speech is now becoming increasingly dangerous in regards to sexual play and secrecy, especially during the second half of this stage.. Actually, secrecy doesn't even exist during this 2nd year.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         An average 2 year old will have a vocabulary of 50 to 250 words, which will increase almost daily. The main difference now, from the earlier year, is that the toddler is now capable of joining several words from its vocabulary into pretty sensible sentences, which obviously is dangerous.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Thus, camouflaging the words of sensitive objects, and whole sentences especially, will be more important now than ever before, while moving through this period.

                         The first difference you will now notice is the loss of baby fat, thus a much more taller and slimmer figure is appearing. They now become way more mature and sexier in the eyes of genuine pedophiles, while still keeping several doll traits that make the nepiophiles drool, as they now enter a gray zone between toddlerhood and preschool.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their motor development will now get a general high boost, as in much more control over their bodies and body parts. Now they can really handle an adult penis pretty well with their small hands, by squeezing and twisting it until you go crazy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you then add much larger mouths at this 3rd age, which now can flawlessly take large adult males deeply inside them, you can only imagine how hot things can get with the right training and guidance provided.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Along with a decreasing rate of tantrums and violence, most of the 3 year olds are becoming increasingly more patient during play and tasks that take some time to complete; thus it's way easier to have sex with 3 year olds than 2 year olds. You will notice a much better calmness in general.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The chances of getting bitten are now slimmer too, though not completely vanished; it's not <u>that</u> uncommon for nepiophiles to end up with cute bite marks on their penises after oral jobs with grumpy 3 year olds.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Another important note about this period, is that the toddlers are now beginning to understand much more than they can express with words. They will now have very complex feelings. So, it's important to be <u>very</u> loving, careful and gentle while making love to them, as they can way more easily <u>understand</u> sexual exploitations and bad treatment.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The most significant and important change for all sorts of sex practice with these totties, is their highly dangerous speech.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         What makes their speech such dangerous now, is the fact that a common 3 year old can express itself flawlessly with close to 1000 words in its vocabulary, with pretty complex sentences and decent expression capabilities.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In the same time, they really don't know the importance of secrecy and social taboos(!).
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         So, however much you try explaining to a 3 year old that 'this needs to be a secret and we can't tell it to anyone', she or he can run straight to mommy and say that 'Daddy and me have a secret, he puts his ding-dong in my mouth!' and tell that with a wide and proud smile, without neither thinking about nor appreciating the consequences of what such a statement can have on poor daddy (and his ding-dong!).
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Even if you now camouflage the names of your genitalia, the child may still know the real worlds for them, and use those instead, if she or he decides to tell about what you just did, which unfortunately most 3 year olds love to do in general.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         3 year olds just can't stop talking; they've suddenly discovered that they can talk pretty flawlessly, and they have so much to say and tell so many people(!).
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         I'm not saying that this will fail with 100% certainty at any given situation, because a lot of nepiophiles and pedophiles are practicing sex with 3 year olds without any problems, as we speak. I'm only saying that the risk of the child revealing your secrets are at its <u>highest</u> at this third year of toddlerhood.

                         The sexual behavior of toddlers is one of those large changes from infancy. Their sexuality will now bloom and become a lot more active and present compared to their latter baby stage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The most important reason for this change is their increased motor skill. An increased motor skill allows them to use their bodies and hands to explore themselves in a way they never where able to do earlier in life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most toddlers at 1 year of age have already done some exploration of their own bodies, which has made them find their genitalia. For those who yet haven't, it will be just a matter of time before they do. And this exploration will just increase and become more advanced with time.
                         
                         <br />

                         The average toddler from the mid to latter part of this stage masturbates regularly. How often it happens depends on all the different toddlers and situations out there, as some are very sexually active while others aren't, and some have better access to their genitals while others haven't.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most toddlers between the ages of 1 and 2 are still using diapers, which obviously barricades their genitals at most parts of the day. However, many are still able to squeeze their tiny hands through various openings, which really proves how strong their sexual needs can actually become.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The toddlers parents and <u>their</u> sexual cultures will also impact the masturbation rate, as some parents are very relaxed and open about it, while others get mad and punishes the tot.
                         
                         <br />

                         Masturbation among toddlers usually occurs because of their natural curiosity towards their own genitalia, but also because it feels nice to do so. Toddlers may also get orgasms now and then during such play, at different levels, which further motivates them to play more with their genitalia.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A regular toddler will of course not have any intellectual understanding about sex, it will just keep on playing with its genitals when possible, and as much as possible.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         At the beginning of toddlerhood, most toddlers will have what is called an egocentric sexuality. This means that their primary sexual interest during the first half of this stage will be mostly about their own bodies, and not the bodies of others.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This egocentric sexuality will slowly shift towards a social sexuality during the last half of toddlerhood, as in switching to an interest for the bodies and genitals of others as well; which of course includes an interest for adults.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         A very interesting feature of toddlers is their lack of ethics. Actually, they don't have any of that at all. As a result, they can easily begin masturbating anywhere at anytime, even in the middle of the living room of the good Christian aunt Gloria during her high prestige tee party. This is usually the average parent's true nightmare, and unfortunately the reason to why so many parents react negatively to such behavior.

                         I've heard about lots of occasions, through my own work, when toddlers actually start to 'ride' on the knees of adults in an attempt to masturbate themselves; not to mention pillows, teddy bears or any soft object they may find to 'ride' themselves off upon. To them, sex just feels good and is fun, so they just do it.

                         Which such a lack of ethics, and such a great curiosity for sex and general horniness, many parents have told me that what they fear most about their children, is that the wrong adult should one day experience their toddlers sexual behavior. And that tells a lot! This tells that this toddler stage is an extremely exploitable age for nepiophiles, and all others who want to have sex with cute children dolls.

                         Such sexual behavior is really an open invitation, written on a creme white invitation card with letters of pure gold, to no other place than Heaven itself. It is an open invitation to sex, which is a crime by itself to <u>not</u> exploit if you experience it.

                         The 1st year of this stage is still considered as fully safe and secure for general sex practice, and still a recommendation for the newbies and newcomers who are unsure about child love practice, and want to stay as safe as possible.

                         The 2nd year of this stage is considered as only partially safe, depending on the speech skills of the toddler, which vary a lot between kids during this year. By carefully switching words and rephrasing certain sentences, you should be very safe; especially during the first half of this year.

                         The 3rd year of this stage is considered as highly dangerous, with few to no tricks to keep them quiet with decent certainty, and definitely not a recommended age for the newbies.
                         
                         <br />

                         And of course, and like with all greater stages of childhood, this stage will increasingly become more challenging than the previous baby stage. These children will be much more conscious and aware, begin to have their own opinions about how things should be and shouldn't, and generally become pretty active, aggressive and have regular tantrums.

                         But toddlers are <u>still</u> natural underdogs, meaning that they are used to be carried around, dressed up and dressed off, placed here and there, and etc. So, an adult with just partial authority should be able to pwn most toddlers during sex.

                         Probably the most interesting part of toddlerhood is the possibility to start <b class="h">penetration training</b> at its very beginning!

                         Performing vagina or anal sex with a toddler is probably the hottest thing in the universe apart from the big bang itself. We're talking about little vaginas and butts so soft and elastic, and so wet and slipper when lube is added, in the same time as being the tightest things you can ever slide slowly inside. When done properly, it can be Heaven for both the child and the nepiophile when the tot is fully trained. And if you should wonder, I will of course guide you through the land of kiddie penetration training later in the handbook.

                         As long as you don't mind risking scratches from sharp nails, bite marks from sharp teeth, and regularly look into red and screaming round faces, while being dangerously close to angry little lions during sexual activities, toddlers can give you many nice tours into Heaven. When they're not angry and dangerous, while being calm and happy, they are the cutest and sweetest little beings in the whole darn universe.

                         Children within this stage are very sexually aggressive anally. According to the great Sigmund Freud, children will during this stage have their rectums as their primarily erogenous zone. This means that they can become sexually aroused by fiddling with their anuses and penetrating their rectums, and even get orgasms from rectal penetrations alone.

                         The preschool stage is the first real transition towards adulthood in terms of physiology and psychology. During this transition and stage, the children will loose most of their typical baby properties from the latter two stages, while gaining much taller and slimmer figures along with much more intellectual and independent minds.

                         <br />

                         This stage can be true horror for many parents, seeing their babies disappearing, while rude and tiny adults are appearing. But then again, this is also the stage of which genuine pedophiles begin gaining their interest and attraction for real, while the nepiophiles will gradually loose theirs.
                         
                         <br />

                         As a part of loosing their baby cuteness and innocence, their sexuality will now switch on for <u>real</u> and become a lot more active and seductive than ever before.

                         The first thing you'll notice with the preschoolers, besides their physical growth and much better understanding of things, is the rapid development of defined personalities. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, most 4 year olds begin to understand that they are unique individuals and unique beings, which makes them way more independent, as in way more capable of thinking for themselves and making their own decisions without looking at adults for help. This has a pretty large impact on their social behavior and skills, and the way they interact with others, which of course also regards interactions with pedophiles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This quick development of their personalities <u>do</u> have a negative side effect, which makes this stage famously known as the brat stage. Their sudden social independence will cause them to have very strong opinions about things, in the same time as many of these opinions are less sensible, making them generally hard and frustrating to handle.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         A more clear and defined sense of humor will now occur, in the same time as they don't take anything seriously, which obviously makes them pretty funny and cool being around.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Social relationships will now become very important to them. They will now look actively for new friends, and all new friendships will be very exciting and important to them. Neither will they be especially picky when choosing friends, making them easily choose adults as new friends too.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         They will also begin to understand the concept of best friends, and any of such will be especially important to them, which also includes adults.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This is also the stage when they begin to develop deep and complex feelings of romance, and begin to truly fall in love with the opposite gender. Yes, even adults! This further leads to an increasing interest for mouth kissing, as it is pretty common for these children to play kissing games with other kids during this stage, which of course may include adults.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their general increased independence during this stage will have the effect of creating a larger separation between them and their parents. Their leashes to their parents will thus become increasingly longer during this stage, making them more free and mobile outdoors. This varies from parent to parent of course, as some are overprotective while others don't care all that much. This is nevertheless important to note for all pedophiles who will search for children outdoors.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Preschoolers are mostly very outgoing and friendly towards others, even strangers. So even though they have been warned by their parents not to talk to strangers, it is very common that they still do; especially if the stranger is a very friendly and exciting person, and a little bit mysterious.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most preschoolers live in a magic fairytale world, not fully able to differ between fantasy and reality. So, they think that the world is just one big fairytale and play arena, which is all safe to be all around, which obviously is a huge advantage for <u>us</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Another easily noticeable property of the preschoolers is their great physical and mental enthusiasm for life and everything in it. This enthusiasm can quickly turn into over-enthusiasm, making them very wild and unpredictable. But not necessarily in a bad way for pedophiles, as it can make them easily do a lot of <u>crazy</u> stuff without thinking twice about it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Two more additional and rather <u>important</u> social properties of the preschoolers is first of all their high interest for social cooperation and participation, and second: their strong natural urge for frequent adult attention and approval. These properties will make these children very interested in new and exciting games, and love to please adults to gain their praise.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Probably the most important part of the preschool stage for pedophiles, is their rapid understanding of secrecy and social taboos. They will now become increasingly better at secret keeping throughout this stage, while also understanding social embarrassments. This will make these children pretty good secret keepers, especially from the age of 5.

                         The sexual behavior of children enters a whole new level as soon as they turn 4 years old. This is the childhood stage that most professional pedophiles refer to as the sexual big bang, as their sexuality more or less explodes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The first thing this stage introduces, is an increased rate of masturbation; especially among the girls. The average preschool girl masturbate herself to 5-10 orgasms a day.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Another change from the earlier childhood stages is that these children will change their egocentric sexual behavior to a social sexual behavior, as in gradually showing a sexual interest towards <u>other</u> humans and <u>their</u> genitalia.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Adult genitalia will be <u>particularly</u> interesting among both preschool girls and boys, simply because our society has forbidden that area as much as it has. The more you forbid something, the more interest and activity it gains.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         What isn't uncommon, and something I've experienced quite often myself, are rude little preschoolers who try to hit or pinch the genital areas of males during silly play, which really is <u>their</u> way of initiating sexual play and seduce you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, thanks to our stupid society, preschoolers are <u>dying</u> to look at, explore and play with our genitals!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The preschoolers are beginning to develop a much more intellectual relationship to sex as well, and will gradually understand that this is a very sensitive and special subject.

                         They will also begin to grasp the link between sex and babies, which further makes genital contact very interesting to them.

                         As a part of their increased sexuality, and a more intellectual relationship to sex, most girls will begin flirting with adult males in very seductive ways. This is easily observable when adult males enter their everyday play and madness, as most of them will be climbing all over the males and fight for their attention and lap.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is just instinctive behavior among preschool girls, and a healthy sign that their brains are developing as they should.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It is also pretty common that these girls begin to experiment with penetration, as they now better understand that the vagina has a mysterious hole that is hungry for <u>something</u>. This leads to a lot of broken hymens already at this stage, after some experimental fingering or insertions of miscellaneous objects.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Since they are now starting to sense and understand social taboos and shame, their masturbation and genital play will become more private. Thus, they will now begin to understand secrecy and how important it really is to keep certain things from other people.
                         
                         <br />

                         Things are obviously starting to happen during this stage, which is a wonderful and exciting stage with very high sexual interest and activity, while they're not especially critical about, nor being that hard to convince, doing a lot of crazy stuff.

                         Those of you who have gone through the toddler stage, have learned that those children can be dangerous to practice sex with because of their notorious chatting, while not understanding nor appreciating the importance of secrecy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Fortunately, this changes at this stage. Most preschoolers are capable of understanding and keeping secrets, making them much safer for sex practice. Though, you may want to be extra careful with the most fresh 4 year olds, as some may yet not be mature enough to fully understand its importance.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         These children have a medium difficulty level for sex practice, thus being even more challenging than the younger toddlers. With moderate intellects and pretty strong and wild personalities, with a decent dose of unpredictability, they usually require some patience and experience from the pedophile for best possible success. Though, all newbies are perfectly welcome to go straight for these children, as long as you read thoroughly through the relevant chapters of this handbook, and are very gentle and careful with the kids.

                         <br />

                         Preschoolers are fully capable of vaginal penetration, all the way from 4 years of age. Of course, correct training is always important to prevent pain or trauma to their genitals.

                         <br />

                         As these children are much more patient than toddlers, it will be way easier to perform longer and more intense sexual activities and intercourses with them, with lots of tiny moans, grunts and orgasms.

                         Actually, since most preschool girls are such sexually active, and enjoys masturbation and orgasms as much as they do, you should prepare yourself for the ride of your life. Many pedophiles have experienced some insane sessions with these girls, with so much lust, so much breathing, and so many orgasms for the both of you.

                         With greater intellects and the capability to feel romance, you will experience a great 2-way communication during any child love and sex practice. Thus, these children are some very interesting and rewarding creatures to have sex with.

                         Children within this stage are very genitally aggressive. According to the great Sigmund Freud, children will from this stage and on have their genitals as their primarily erogenous zone. This means that they can become sexually aroused by fiddling with or penetrating their genitals.

                         The elementary school age represents yet another important change towards adulthood, both physically and mentally.

                         However, the changes during this stage won't be as dramatic as they where between the former stages. The development curve will now begin to flatten out.

                         These children will increasingly become more smarter and skeptical, and calm way down both socially and sexually, all of which introduce both disadvantages and advantages for the pedophiles in regards to friendships, seductions and sex.

                         The typical preschool wildness and unpredictability will decay quickly from 6 to 8 years of age, being mostly gone by the age of 8. You will notice way more patient and generally calm children within this stage. Of course, all young children will have lots of energy within, but these children are <u>now</u> beginning to control this energy in a way more mature way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most children of this stage will begin developing way more adult like figures during the first 2 years, meaning slimmer bodies and longer faces that resemble adults more, contrary to the way more round and puffy bodies and faces of the earlier stages. The girls will additionally develop wider hips, which will be clearly noticed already from 7 years of age.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         One factor with these children that usually causes a greater challenge for all pedophiles, is that these children will be much harder to befriend and seduce compared to the earlier stages. Their increased maturity will make them way more independent and self-thinking, thereby way more aware, careful, critical and picky towards unusual things. This doesn't apply to all children, but unfortunately it applies to most.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         On the contrary, as a positive breeze, this highly increased independence does also mean high mobility and less protection by their guardians. Compared to the earlier stages, these children will be found in much greater numbers outdoors, increasing the odds of finding a <span class="glow_yellow">special child</span> whom will be easy for you to befriend and seduce.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Unfortunately, once again, these children tend to develop an increasing shyness towards adults during this stage, which will only be increased if their parents teach them to avoid strangers. This will make it further challenging for pedophiles.

                         Social relationships and friendships become even more important now than ever before, and way more complex. However, during this stage, most children will begin to prefer friends at their own age rather than adults.

                         <br />

                         Their ability to feel romance and fall in love will also become increasingly stronger and complex during this stage. But all children are, thank God, capable of falling in love with <u>adults</u> just as much as similarly aged children.

                         Status and looks are starting to become important parts of choosing friends and lovers among the older kids of this stage. If you have lots of money and great looks, you will find it easier befriending and seducing them, contrary to having neither. This doesn't mean however that it is game over if you are poor and have average looks, it just means that things will then become increasingly more challenging.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         There's one very interesting and important difference between girls and boys at this stage:

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         While these girls are usually known to be more aware, careful, critical and picky towards unusual things, the boys within this stage are usually the opposite of that. These boys are usually way more open and fearless, with a hunger to explore and try rough and dangerous things, while <u>additionally</u> being less protected by their guardians on average.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         You may look at this as the boy lovers revenge; the girl lovers have been able to exploit some unique features of the younger children girls, especially their horniness and orgasm abilities all the way from baby stage, and the preschool girls lust for male closeness and love. Now the tables are about to turn, as the girls become way more retracted and foppish, while the boys become the opposite of that, while <u>also</u> becoming more available outdoors.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This makes it way more easier for the boy lovers to find friends and lovers within this stage, contrary to the girl lovers.

                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Several girl lovers have actually gone over to the opposite side of the fence and found some sweet and feminine boys instead, as they have been much easier to find, befriend and seduce for sexual activities.

                         The girls will continue masturbating a lot, and their general sexual curiosity may even get stronger than before. But there won't be any explosions nor surprises during this stage, it will rather just be a careful and further development into a more calm, mature and <u>private</u> sexual behavior.

                         However, the 6 year olds will still be quite crazy and seductive, which will continue a couple of more years into this new stage of elementary school age.

                         But from the age of 8 or so, most girls will gradually calm down and close up, along with an increasing shyness and awareness towards adults and strangers. Luckily, there will always be exceptions out there, like some girls will always be wild and careless, and there will always be <span class="glow_yellow">special children</span> to be found, either of which will be pretty easy to seduce.

                         The boys however, will now move from less sexually active to become super horny, especially towards their puberty. They will increasingly begin masturbating more correctly and consistently, and finally start getting those real orgasms with semen, and just become all crazy about sexual pleasure, explorations and experimentations. This means that they will also be far more open for sexual play among each other, even with adults, thus far more likely to be successfully seduced.

                         The sexuality of these children, regardless of gender, will increasingly become very advanced, controlled and stronger. These children will generally start having a very mature relationship towards masturbation and sex.

                         The biggest difference with these children, regarding sex, compared to any earlier stage, is their sexual maturity. This will make you able to have some very complex sexual relationships with children, which can involve deep romance and great communicative sex, whether it is on a short or longterm basis.

                         You can really talk together, teach them how to do advanced things, and explore and experience many pleasures together, within quite calm, stable and secure circumstances.

                         Penetration, both vaginal and anal, will become a lot easier. Like, most 6-8 year olds can be quickly trained to take large adult males inside them.

                         Their ability to understand taboos and secrets moves over to a whole new level with these children, meaning that these children will be very good at keeping secrets, thus extremely safe to practice sex with in that regard.

                         It can be challenging seducing children at this stage, especially girls at the later part of it. But, when you succeed doing that, regardless of gender, you will get some very rewarding and safe kiddie sex as a pedophile.

                         Adolescence is the very last stage of childhood, and the very beginning of adulthood. This is the final transition that all children go through, and is a transition that is all about leaving the childhood behind, like a butterfly leaving its cocoon, and entering the final stage of life as adults.

                         These children will be more like adults rather than children, but they won't be complete adults yet, thus giving them some really interesting features that all hebephiles who like more mature children can embrace and love.

                         Puberty is the key word for this stage, which the kids usually enter somewhere between the ages of 9 and 13.

                         <br />

                         As always, the girls are usually a couple of years ahead of the boys in this regard, so girls can enter puberty already at 9, while the boys can enter it already at 11.

                         But, there are no specific rules in nature regarding puberty, some may enter it even earlier while others much later.

                         As soon as the children enter puberty, they become what's popularly known as <b class="h">adolescents</b>.

                         The difference between girls and boys at this stage is actually greater than of any previous. The girls will generally act calm, mature and think things through, while the boys will act pretty much the opposite of that.

                         Those of you who read through the toddler and preschool stages of this chapter, may remember that the toddlers went through tantrums, and the preschoolers where quite wild, unstable and unpredictable; and that this behavior changed to more calm and stable as soon as they entered the elementary school stage. Ironically, these adolescents will unfortunately fall back on the toddlers tantrums, and the wildness, instability and unpredictability of the preschoolers, which is kind of cute and funny if you think about it. Of course, not in an identical way, but still with many similarities.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The reason for tantrums, instability and unpredictability among adolescents, is the puberty itself:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         <b class="h">Puberty</b> is the biological process of leaving the childhood for adulthood. This involves a large biological change inside the human body that happens very fast over a very short amount of time. This causes a hormonal imbalance in the body that makes the brain emotionally unstable during the process, causing most adolescents to change between high and low moods, become socially and emotionally oversensitive, and gain temporarily traits from hyper-sexuality disorder. And all these mental factors can change several times a day, making them potentially very hard to handle for most parents. However, all adolescents handle puberty differently; some are averagely quite calm while others become next to insane.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Puberty does also cause some physical changes, like pubic hair, increased body hair, increased muscle mass among boys, and breasts and wider hips among girls. Weight gain, weight loss and pimples can also occur in some instances, making puberty especially challenging for the girls.

                         This is also the period when they go riot on their guardians; usually a nightmare for the guardians, but an advantage for the hebephiles, as this rioting is all about doing all the bad things you can imagine to piss off their guardians, while stimulating their own strong need for independence. This usually becomes even more severe among those adolescents who have issues with their guardians and/or living conditions.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Social relationships become more important for these children than ever before. They feel a strong need to be socially popular at this stage, and thus be in popular social groups. And they hate more than anything to be left out of any group, especially become teased or bullied.
                         
                         <br />

                         Bullied adolescents will especially be looking for new friends, which of course may include adults.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But what many adolescents truly appreciate, especially those who have problems during this stage, is to have a special friendship with a cool adult whom listens to them and understands them, and is on their side and in their corner all the time, regardless of how ridiculous their opinions become; someone mature, and maybe a little bit mysterious and dangerous, to lean onto when the whole world is against them. And it gets even better if this adult buys them alcohol, cigarettes, grass and etc; while having some money to throw around. And of course, owning a cool car.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If these relationships are cross gender, like a cool adult male who takes a troubled adolescent girl underneath his wings, these relationships usually, like 9 out of 10 times, end up as romantic; and eventually sexual. And suddenly, there you are, two people against the world, and all that shit, while the adult keeps adding fuel to the fire by letting the young girl fully release that rebellion monster inside her.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         By all means, this could be a male-male relationship as well; an adult with lots of gaming equipment, alcohol and porn at home. Just imagine all the nice things <u>that</u> could lead to.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their romantic feelings will be pretty similar to adults, in other words completely developed and very strong. The puberty will even amplify this; so when an adolescent falls in love, she or he will fall in love for <u>real</u>, with all of its body and soul.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, love usually doesn't last that long with these kids.

                         The biggest advantage for hebephiles is that these children are super independent. They are to be found outdoors in huge quantities, being all alone and unwatched. The late elementary schoolers may have long leaches, but adolescents are more or less <u>unleashed</u>. And those of them who are yet not unleashed by their parents, will go pretty far to become so, which most eventually do anyway.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         But, even though they are easily available and unwatched, they can be quite difficult to contact, befriend and seduce. Because, these kids will be very awake and alerted, with an intellect very close to an adult, thus being hard to convince, trick and fool. To succeed, you will either need to do things very carefully and correctly, with surgical precision, or find yourself a very troubled adolescent who'll glue itself onto you.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And, even though they now are closer to the adults than ever, even the 15 year olds will still have some immaturity and childishness left inside. They will still be pretty small and light, have cute faces, and freshly developed and firm breasts and genitals. It really is a wonderful stage with many interesting features for all hebephiles to explore; or anyone else for that matter who wants a young female or male to make love to.

                         As soon as the kids enter puberty and become reproductive, their sexual needs are no longer primarily based on their curiosity. Now it is the hormone Testosterone that takes over, and this gives birth to an extremely powerful and active sexuality, so extreme thanks to the hormonal imbalance of puberty, that it makes most adolescents supernova horny.

                         Both girls and boys will become very horny during their adolescence, but the boys will become the horniest ones. The balls of adolescent boys can be masturbated a dozen times during a day, and be just as horny and filled with cum the next. But regardless of gender, by being so horny and sexually active all the time, they will be very motivated to do a lot of crazy stuff and sexual experimentations, all the way from stripping in front of web cams to actually sucking adult cocks and having lots of sexual intercourses.

                         They will get a sexual big bang alright, like the preschoolers, but they will also be way more restricted and less seductive <u>than</u> the preschoolers.

                         We're talking about very horny, confused and experimenting youth here, who are easily accessible without much of adult protection, and who know all about secrecy and how important that is, even without mentioning it. They are also close to fully developed for both vagina and anal sex, without needing any excessive training in advance.

                         In the same time, they are still just <u>kids</u> in so many ways!

                         Having sex with these kids will therefore become pretty much easy and straightforward for most adults, and actually not all that different from having sex with adults.

                         The youngest ones however, like the 11 and 12 year olds, will always appreciate some sort of care, patience and training in advance, to avoid fear, discomfort and pain. But this shouldn't become much complex nor time consuming anyway.

                         And regardless of age and gender, they <u>can</u> become nervous about engaging sexual relationships in general. So, even though they are very horny and wild, they can still become challenging to seduce and have sex with.
