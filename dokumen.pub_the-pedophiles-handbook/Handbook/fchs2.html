                         Since all the preparations have now been completed, it is time to move to the next level of kiddie hunting, which actually is <u>hunting</u> for children at your selected hunting location.

                         This part has been especially crafted to become an easy continuation and a comfortable transition from the latter part. So, our main focus is still on excitement and fun, while still staying very safe and secure, without any high expectations nor any pressure towards your performance. This is still all about trying things out and seeing where that leads you.
                                             
                         <br />

                         Though, we <u>will</u> move up a notch during this part. This means getting close to potential preys, and generally closer to the action out in the field, which will make you an easier target for unwanted attention, suspicions and confrontations.
                         
                         <br />

                         Luckily, you will have lots of control when you're out in the field and hunting for kiddies. You, as the hunter, have the power to decide the distance and grade of your own hunting.
                         
                         <br />

                         And you won't be braking any laws during this part, as you will <u>only</u> exercise your freedom to travel wherever you want to; initially as a tourist, and ideally with a camouflaged reason as I taught you all about in the former <a class="set3" href="fchs1.html#link1" target="_blank">preparation part</a>.

                         Thus, you will <u>still</u> have lots of room for exploration and common newbie mistakes during this part.

                         This part of the Hunting Season will be all about finding yourself a prey to stalk, and finding the right place and time to approach it and make contact for the first time.
                         
                         <br />

                         And, you can use whatever time you need to accomplish this.

                         The next and final part of the Hunting Season will be all about actually <u>performing</u> the first approach and contact; and from there try initiating a new friendship, which hopefully will develop into a nice and delicious sexual activity in the end.
                         
                         <br />

                         Because, the final goal of the Hunting Season <u>is</u> after all to have sexual activities with children. You may have a child just jerking you off while it smiles and giggles, whether it is out of pure curiosity or to whore itself for treats. Or, you may lay down onto the leafs within the woods somewhere, with a shivering and excited child in your arms, to make love for the first time, while becoming the child's first male.

                         You can do whatever you want to, with whatever child you end up finding. As already stated: the possibilities are really endless when you're outdoors and hunting for children.

                         There's something special about that first run, whether you sit in your car or on a train on the way to your hunting location. You are on your way to actually spot for real children preys to stalk around, and finally take down. Even the professionals have some sweaty hands and a few butterflies flying around in their stomachs, before they arrive to start on the real hunts.

                         This sensation is the sensation of <u>life</u> itself, the sensation of feeling <u>alive</u>, like never before.

                         Life is too short and too precious to be wasted behind a computer while feeling sorry for oneself, and only looking at images and videos of children. All pedophiles should get out there and claim their right to make love to children. You only live <u>once</u>, and this is <u>your</u> chance to experience true pedophile love and erotica, in various possible ways. And this is the true essence of the pedophile Hunting Season.

                         There are certain preys who are easier to take down than others. In other words, there are certain children who are easier to approach, contact, befriend, and finally seduce, than the majority of children out there.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Thus, it is very important that you first learn what sort of children who will be the easiest targets, before you start on the actual stakeouts. You will need to know <u>what</u> to spot for if you want to make it easier for yourself as a kiddie hunter.

                         This is especially important to learn for newbies and everyone who're skeptical and insecure towards this method, because this knowledge may actually make your kiddie hunting almost ridiculously easy and safe to accomplish.

                         There aren't only children out there of different genders, ages, sizes and colors, there are also children out there of different life situations. And not all life situations are all that nice; some can actually become pretty nasty. Thus, the world is filled with what many pedophiles refer to as <span class="glow_yellow">special children</span>.

                         A special child is a child who's <u>different</u> from the rest.

                         This difference can be related to social problems, like being an outsider, socially excluded, or a victim of bullying. It can also be related to care problems, like critical lack of adult attention, love and care, and lacking parenting in general. They can also be victims of various types of domestic abuse.

                         These children can be easily spotted by the way they act; and their first common trait is <b class="h">loneliness</b>.

                         When you look at a bunch of children in a large group playing, there are usually a few children here and there who don't participate with the majority, and don't seem to have much of regular friends. They're simply alone, even among other kids.

                         You can also spot such children as they play all alone and all by themselves at playgrounds and other special places in their neighborhoods; or when they walk slowly and all alone on deserted roads and paths; or having special and private places, like in the woods, where they retract to, away from the society that they don't thrive nor feel comfortable within.

                         Their second common trait is <b class="h">behavior problems</b>, as in children who are extremely aggressive and bullying towards other children and adults.
                         
                         <br />

                         They're usually not doing this just to be bad persons, they're doing this because they usually have social and personal problems that fill them with pain and frustration, all of which they need to get out of their systems through violent behavior.

                         Or, they do it because they want adult attention; as some children learn that the <u>only</u> way to grab the adults attention, is to be bad and do bad stuff, so they get confronted by it.

                         We're talking about disturbed children here, in other words, children whom don't belong to the majority, of various reasons.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such children are usually extremely open and very little critical towards strangers, adults in particular. They got a hunger for attention, love and being liked, above anything else in life. Thus, if you can provide them with these important things, which all pedophiles should be easily able to do, you'll quickly gain and for a long time keep their trust, friendship and intimacy. Sometimes, these children will just grab you and hold on to you, and be willing to do <u>anything</u> and <u>everything</u> to make sure you stay in their lives and don't leave them.

                         Some can be easily spotted, while others need a closer look to be seen. But they <u>are</u> out there; and they're waiting for you to see them, notice them, appreciate them, compliment them, touch them, and be their special and exciting friend.

                         The very first task you will need to do as a kiddie hunter, is to spot for preys at your preferred kiddie hot-spots.

                         This is the part of your Hunting Season that definitely will give you an exciting feeling of being serious about finding yourself a child to seduce; while in the same time having the comfort of not doing anything critical nor illegal yet.

                         This is something you can safely do for as long as you like to, and a great way to further explore pedophilia hunting if you're new to this.

                         As an important part of your earlier preparations, you should already have found either one or several kiddie hot-spots. And ideally, a nice stakeout point for each one.
                         
                         <br />

                         I will now go through each of the most common hot-spots used, and provide you with important information that should fit most other locations similar to the ones I've selected.

                         Thus, you will now need to go to your first preferred hot-spot to look for and find yourself a sweet little kiddie prey.

                         Don't look at this as something that <u>needs</u> to be accomplished or succeeded in a special way anytime soon. Just enjoy yourself, optionally with some junk-food, and just take your time and take all this as an exciting game.

                         It's important to enjoy the excitement and fun of doing this, while using a moment to think about how far you've come: you're now actually <u>spotting</u> for children preys as a pedophile, and you're <u>on</u> your way to find an ideal prey to hunt down.

                         When you have found and chosen your prey, we will move to the next task of this part, which is stalking it around to learn important information about sweet little her or him.

                         There aren't many places in the world that all by their own contain as much children at one place as elementary schools conveniently do; or any other school or child care institution for that matter. It is the perfect place for a pedophile hunter to use as a starting point for kiddie hunting.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With a decent view over the school arena, you can easily monitor all the pupils outside when they play in the schoolyard between their classes. You can also see all the children arriving at school in the morning, and see them leave in the afternoon when school is over. You can individually study many different children from a safe position, and especially look for those special ones who <span class="glow_yellow">glow</span>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus the first thing to do, is simply to just start monitoring the school and its yards, ideally from a decent and safe stakeout point that you've previously selected.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It can be any day in the week really; but ideally during the mid part of the days, so you can watch the schoolyard during the long midday breaks. Or, you can be there all the way from the school opens to it closes, if able to, to get a full overview.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When the children are inside during their classes, you may want to take a break and just stretch your legs some. It is not healthy to sit still for several hours in a row.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will now see lots of children playing and running around in the school yard, almost like a chaos:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can be very confusing the first time. But after some time and practice, and when gaining some stakeout experience, you will first start to <u>recognize</u> some children by their clothes and behavior. You may thus quickly find a nice little girl or boy whom you immediately fall for. It can be the child's looks that catches your attention and keeps it on it. It can be that special personality that is extremely attractive. Or, it <span class="glow_yellow">glows</span>!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Eventually, you will start to see a <u>pattern</u> in the chaos:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will see children doing many of the same things over and over again during the outside breaks. You will see some children getting into buses at the end of the day, while others get on their bikes or take certain routes by foot to get home. The same children will arrive at school early the next morning, and a certain pattern will keep on repeating itself day in and day out; the same kids, the same clothes, the same behavior, and the same routines in the schoolyard.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such patterns are important for pedophiles. Patterns equals predictabilities, and predictabilities equals opportunities.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And there's nothing like hearing those ambient sounds of children laughter and screams from the distance, while you're sitting there in hide and just watching them!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After some days and sessions of stakeouts, you will begin feeling more confident and safe towards what you're doing. You will start to get a sense of overview and control.
                         
                         <br />

                         Use your time and patience to select a prey; and don't expect Rome to be built in just one day. Newbies will have to do a lot of schoolyard surveying before they learn how to select ideal preys. But the practice itself is so much fun!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Try to concentrate on only <u>one</u> prey at a time, or else it can become pretty messy. Of course, you may 'bookmark' several alternate preys for later, if you want to.
                         
                         <br />

                         Then it is time to move to the stalking section of this chapter, and learn how to stalk your selected prey.

                         A nice place to spot for children at early and late evenings, especially during the weekends, are local playgrounds within your current hunting location. Most locations have either one or several playgrounds, whether they are standalone playgrounds, or parks with recreational equipment within.

                         Please note that some schools, preschools, daycare facilities and other child institutions may have playgrounds that are available to the public after their hours.

                         You can find children of all ages at these playgrounds, even toddlers; but the ones who're most likely for you to seduce, and the ones you probably should have your eyes on, would be the 4-6 year olds and older. Unless, you plan to kidnap.

                         Just as with elementary schools, move to your stakeout point where you can safely and comfortably study the arena.

                         Watching playgrounds is in many ways similar to watching schools and other child institutions; except for when you now arrive, it will most likely be empty.

                         Contrary to schools, playgrounds are known to be unstable and unpredictable kiddie hot-spots. There are usually no regular streams of children each day arriving, playing, and then leaving. You may sit there for a whole day watching, but no one appears. Or, you may see lots of children already being there as you arrive. And those who do arrive, usually visit these playgrounds randomly and unpredictably.

                         Thus, these hunting locations will require patience and luck.

                         But then again, and also contrary to schools, when the children finally <u>do</u> arrive, playgrounds are way easier to study. They will contain far less children, so it will be way easier to look at children individually.

                         Some come with their parents or nannies, while others come without adults, either all alone or with friends. The older children will obviously and more likely come without adults.
                         
                         <br />

                         Even if they're accompanied by parents or nannies, you can <u>still</u> stalk them afterwards to see where they lead, which may turn out to be interesting places, situations and opportunities.

                         When spotting at playgrounds and seeing children at play, unlike schools, it is impossible to know when they'll return. Thus, you will now not be able to monitor the visiting children individually on a regular basis over longer periods of times. This will make it harder to select a prey, as you will now have to make way quicker decisions about what kid to select; and that kid will have to be stalked as in right away.

                         This usually requires some experience; but a newbie can still be lucky and pick a nice prey, by using some common sense and gut feelings, and successfully stalk it around.

                         Sports fields are some very interesting locations for kiddie hunting, of several good reasons:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Most children love ball sports, whether it's football, baseball, or whatever outdoors ball sport that's popular in your country. Most parents also want their children to be active and healthy. These hunting locations are therefore usually quite active, especially if the nearby town or community has a decent size.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Not only are they active, but they're also very stable and predictable regarding visitations, at least when you learn when all the different teams practice and perform matches. This information can be found by some careful researching. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         They contain a lot of different children too, at various ages, girls as boys, but probably most boys.
                         
                         <br />

                         These sports fields can also contain children at play when they're not officially in use, as kids also use them for their own private practice of different ball sports; or just general play.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         As always, it's best to have a preselected and discreet stakeout point when spotting for preys at all sports fields. Thus, this should be your first move.
                                        
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, sports fields do have an unique property: if the field has a decent size, and especially during kiddie matches, there are so many people visiting to watch them, that you can actually be one of the audience.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In this way, you can come pretty close to the children, without attracting too much unwanted attention; even with a camera.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, there are lots of adults out there, with a great interest for sports, who enjoy watching amateur children sports, because it makes the sport more innocent and cute.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As long as the match is public and open for all to visit, no one can stop you from becoming one of the audience when spotting for preys at sports arenas.
                                        
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, smaller sports fields in sparse areas will be harder to visit as an audience without attracting negative attention. The same goes for visiting regular practices, as the practices usually contain far less visitors than grand matches. Suddenly there's a stranger there among the audience, and they will be naturally curious about whom you are and why you're there.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I guess public visitations won't be a good advice for the newcomers and skeptical hunters, unless you're quite brave, outwards and self-confident. Thus, only be among the audience  and in public if you really know what you're doing.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         There's one major drawback with most sports fields though: most children use helmets and protection gear. Thus, it may become difficult to actually see their faces.
                         
                         <br />

                         And special children, you know those who <span class="glow_yellow">glow</span>, are rarely to be seen at such places; in sports teams with other children whom are mostly self-confident, active and quite popular.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Whether it is from a discreet stakeout point, or boldly from the audience, pick yourself a sporty and delicious little prey.
                                        
                         <br />

                         Then it is time to move to the stalking section of this chapter, and learn how to stalk your selected prey.

                         One <u>wonderful</u> thing about shopping malls, is that you don't need a stakeout point. You can just park your car at the parking lot and walk inside it, among all other people, and start finding preys while being right in the middle of a crowd.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And if that wasn't enough, you may also come <u>very</u> close to your preys and <u>immediately</u> begin stalking them around.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You can do all this while being safely camouflaged by all the strained people moving all over the place, being all focused on shopping and getting back home before diner.
                         
                         <br />

                         You will probably find more girls than boys at these malls, while most girls being independent adolescents. These are therefore very suitable hot-spots for hebephile girl lovers.

                                   Large shopping malls may be hard to find in the smaller towns. In such cases, you can just  promenade through the town itself, as if it was a large shopping mall. It will most likely have several popular stores and hangouts, with children hanging around.

                         Large shopping malls contain several places where children can be easily found. Toy stores are the number one hunting ground to check out if you want to look for the younger preys of both genders. Clothing and perfume shops will contain the older kiddie and young teenie girls; while similarly aged boys will be found in the electronics departments. And don't forget to check out all the candy and ice cream booths as well.

                         Something that needs special attention here, is that some large shopping malls contain playground departments/booths for children inside. And you would've been amazed to know how many careless parents there are who drop off their children at these departments, to play all by their own, when they want to shop in peace without having their brats hanging from their ankles. Some of these kids are even pretty young.

                                   One time when I was shopping at a middle sized shopping mall a few years back, I accidentally went by a play booth with some children playing within it.

                                   There where three children playing there, totally unattended. The older two seemed like a 6 and 8 year old boy and girl. However, the youngest kid, who grabbed my attention for real, was a seemingly 3 year old girl who had a blast in there.

                                   Seemingly, she wasn't related to nor in any play with the older kids; she was totally alone and playing.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   I just had to sit down on a bench nearby to just see what was going on there. And to my shock, the older children eventually left the booth, leaving the 3 year old all alone, but still having a blast in there. She even looked at me and smiled, and I smiled back at her, could almost feel my face blush.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   I timed the whole event, in the name of science, and she was totally unattended in there for 23+ minutes; and 11 of those minutes without the other two kids. I finally noticed that her mom wasn't that far away after all, but she still had no overview over here daughter for those 23 minutes I was there watching.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   If I had wanted to, I could've used my experience and charm to ask her if she wanted an ice cream, and we would've been out of there in no time. And I would've gotten myself a free toddler.

                         Though, some malls <u>do</u> offer carer guards to watch these children, as a customer service; especially the largest ones.

                         Anyway, such booths can be nice to do stakeouts at, as they will contain lots of young children, conveniently gathered in one single area, where you can be very close to if you like.

                                   If you ever get close to young children at such malls, even some of the older ones as well, always keep in mind that their parents might not be that far away, thus appear at any time.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   Thus, it's probably best to just <u>observe</u> and <u>stalk</u> at these malls, and only <u>interact</u> with children if you're an experienced kiddie hunter or very sure about the safety of your actions; especially when additionally knowing the mall and its environment well.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Some shopping malls, especially in the US and UK, have a decent surveillance system. That means shopping mall guards sitting and monitoring the visitors through surveillance cameras placed all over the mall. They look for general suspicious activities, like shop thieves, robbers, and nowadays terrorists.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Thus, you may not want to hang out there too long, and stalk too many children around, during only <u>one</u> visit and session.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   It can be a good idea to split your hunt into several sessions, with a few days in between, while wearing different clothes at each visit. Then they will have a hard time noticing you among the hundreds of other visitors whom come everyday.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   The best way to avoid unwanted attention from surveillance, or from any other who's around, is to blend in. You should therefore become a shopper yourself, and act like one.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Thus at once you enter the mall, it is a very good idea to go straight to e.g. a male clothing store and buy some cheap rags, so you'll get a shopping bag with merchandises inside. And then regularly stop to look at suitable products during your roving, while acting like you're really interested in them.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   And if you plan to stay there for a while, make a few more purchases of cheap products that are easy to carry around, giving you even more bags to carry, blending even more in.
                         
                              </div>

                         <br />
                    
                         Weekends and holidays are the best times to hunt at such arenas. Then they will be filled with people and children, along with much stress and noise. This will be perfect for blending in and performing undetected spotting and stalking of kids.
                         
                         <br />

                         You know, Christmas time is the time when most kiddies get snatched at such malls, especially young children at these internal playgrounds. If you're carrying a crying toddler out of there, most people won't see a snatching in progress, but rather a toddler with a tantrum, among several other toddlers with real tantrums as well, screaming and kicking, which is pretty common at such places in such stressed out times. And who cares anyway? It's Christmas, and most people are freaked out in pure stress. A well dressed kidnapper with fake shopping bags can easily get himself a free kid, if he times it well and being bold and cool about it. It will be even easier for a female kidnapper.

                         The latter fact, even though being the most extreme action a pedophile can perform as a kiddie hunter, just proves what sort of possibilities such malls can offer us kiddie hunters.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You really don't have anything to fear as a kiddie hunter at large shopping malls, if you're there only to spot and stalk.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, just enter a mall and begin searching. It's very convenient, and just as exciting.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may want to check out the outside area first, and see if there are any places where children seem to regularly hang. Adolescent girls seem to do this a lot.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As already mentioned, it's best to blend in and camouflage yourself as a real customer and shopper. So, the first recommended thing to do, is to go and buy yourself something of a decent size but still light to carry, like some cheap male clothing.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then it's just to start visiting the right areas of the mall and start looking for children; and just move all around the mall.
                                        
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Instead of looking for preys from a stakeout point, with a pair of binoculars, you'll now be able to come very close to them. You will be able to almost smell them, like if you pass them in a crowded area, seemingly accidentally. Coming so close to the children and your preys is <u>very</u> unique, and only possible with such kiddie hot-spots as these.
                         
                         <br />

                         Just be patient while spotting for an ideal prey.
                                        
                         <br />

                         <span class="important">Important</span>

                                   If you spot a very attractive prey, and the mall has only <u>one</u> main exit, instead of following the prey all around the mall, and risk detection and suspicions, most professionals tend to wait around the main exit area instead; like sitting in a public lounge or cafeteria nearby where you can monitor the doors, ideally while reading a newspaper or anything similar. As soon as your prey exits, <u>then</u> you can move to the stalking.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This is an exceptionally great trick to use at small malls, where detections and suspicions are much easer achieved, while these small malls usually have just one exit anyway.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   If you do need to follow a prey all around the mall, try to avoid following it into all the different stores. Rather wait outside, from a distance, and look at some products while you monitor the exit of those particular stores.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   And always keep the longest distance possible, without staring too much at them directly. As soon as they turn around and look straight into your eyes, it usually means game over; because then they've noticed you, and will thus become aware of you.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Don't worry if you occasionally loose your preys in shopping malls, as they won't run away; just speed up some until you see them again.

                         As soon as you get out of the mall, with a prey in mind and sight, it is time to move to the stalking section of this chapter, and learn how to stalk your selected prey.

                         And please note that when carrying bags of merchandises along with you during the stalking, it will become even easier to stalk the children around without getting revealed, as you'll be nicely camouflaged as a shopper on its way home.

                         A common factor that regards all neighborhoods in the world, is that most children don't like being indoors and inactive. They like being outdoors, being free, running around, cycling, and playing at various different locations in their local areas. And several of these play sites can be pretty isolated too.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, common neighborhoods are nice hunting locations that have always been used, and is being used today as we speak, by hundreds of thousands of pedophiles worldwide.
                         
                         <br />

                         But there are some important key differences that separate all neighborhoods from each other, with each of their own unique properties, advantages and disadvantages:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="wealthy"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">Wealthy</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Wealthy neighborhoods have the least amount of children available outdoors. Most of these parents have lots of resources; so instead of letting their children run all around the neighborhood unsupervised, they usually hire nannies and keep their children locked up inside their large castles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These parents are usually of a high intellectual standard too, with few to none personal or social problems. Thus, they're usually very careful, observant and protective of their children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some of these parents are even high profile people in their societies, making them even more protective of their kids.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, many of these parents are too occupied with their work, status and wealth, so their children actually become a low priority in their lives. Some of these kids don't even have a nanny to use as a replacement parent; or they do have one, but they don't like her all that much.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, <u>some</u> of these children do actually escape their castles to search for attention, care and excitement elsewhere.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The younger ones seem to retract to hidden places in the local area, like secret places in nearby woods. The older children and adolescents seem to turn rebellion on their parents, and retract to shopping malls and other questionable hangouts, smoking and looking like whores.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Whatever they usually do or not do, and whatever age they're at, some of these rich children crave for adult attention and love, while others are easily willing to do some crazy stuff just to nag their parents; making them all initially very easy to approach and befriend, and seduce sexually in the end.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, these neighborhoods aren't exactly filled with children, but the few being available, are usually very easy targets.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Unfortunately, such nice neighborhoods, especially the high-end, are very protected by the police and local guards.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And then adding the quietness and calmness, with very little human activities around, these neighborhoods can become challenging to hunt within, without attracting unwanted and negative attention.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It always helps to have a nice car or being to a certain point well dressed when moving around in such neighborhoods, especially the most richest ones.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Time and patience is probably what you'll be needing the most in such areas. But the payoffs that these neighborhoods are capable of giving you in return, can be enormous. Unwanted and unattended rich brats are some <u>true</u> bargains of preys, when obtained. Healthy, clean and stunningly beautiful little creatures, whom you can smell, kiss, lick and enjoy safely for several hours and sessions.

                         I've already written some about the importance of poor neighborhoods and communities in the <a class="set3" href="fcm1.html#start" target="_blank">Kiddie Magnets</a> guide. Because poor, unprotected and unwanted children offer some very unique properties for active pedophiles.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Poor neighborhoods and communities are probably the places where you're most likely to find several suitable preys, who'll be the easiest ones to obtain as well, contrary to any other kiddie hot-spot and hunting location out there.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         I don't want to offend anyone, but people do live in such areas for a reason. And the reason is that they've got one or several problems. If they hadn't had any problems, they would have moved to a much better place.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These problems can be many, but the major ones are usually: bad economy, unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, psychological illnesses, and lacking citizenship. And it can be either <u>one</u> or <u>several</u> of these problems.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's not nice to live in such areas, as they're usually very noisy, crowded, unstable and contain lots of criminal activities. These are not places where most <u>prefer</u> to raise their kids. But children are still being raised there, because their parents don't have any other choices available.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These people lack the important basis to build anything solid on, so they sort of end up at the bottom of a dark well, without any easy nor realistic ways to get up and out of it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These weaknesses are the exact things that pedophiles can exploit to gain easy sexual access to their children. And the funny thing about this, is that pedophiles and poor children do <u>both</u> benefit on such exploitations.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such areas do usually contain a lot of residents, and almost half of them have children. Several of these parents either don't care nor have the resources to adequately protect and care for their little ones, whom often are left alone without adult supervision to hang out somewhere in the area, either all by themselves or in various groups of children. And most of these children are obviously affected by bad parenting, making some them very vulnerable to nice strangers whom show them attention and care, while others will be willing to do a lot of crazy stuff without even hesitating.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, you quickly see where this leaves these children, and where this leaves you as a pedophile kiddie hunter.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Contrary to the wealthy neighborhoods, neither the politicians nor the police prioritize these areas that much. Along with common criminals and miscellaneous weirdos, there should be a large room for odd behavior. Though, less police equals more vigilance; getting caught down there by certain civilians for fiddling with their poor kids, would be a <u>very</u> bad thing! Carefulness and self-protection must thus be much practiced.

                         My general advice is to move your hunting grounds towards the latter sort of neighborhoods, as these will contain the highest amount of kids and the least amount of intellectual and protective parents.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These will also be the best neighborhoods to roam around in without attracting too much attention either; and you won't be stopped by the police anytime soon, even if your actions become suspicious to some extent.

                         We're talking about trashy but beautiful children of poorness and low resources, looking for something nice and special to grab on to, something exciting, so they can temporarily forget about their everyday pain and struggle. We're talking about trashy and beautiful children who want to earn some easy cash by pleasing pedophiles sexually, so they can buy something nice for themselves, and feel good about themselves. We're talking about some <u>really</u> interesting kiddie hot-spots for pedophiles to find easy preys within, either for short or longterm relationships.

                         As been stated earlier, you may already be living in such a neighborhood or community, or at least nearby. And if you don't, you should have the cash to move there, as in just renting a cheap apartment in an area with lots of poor and problematic children of all ages running around. So, these areas aren't only ideal places to seduce children within, but <u>everyone</u> can live there and become permanent leeches; something which many professional hunters do as we speak.

                         Most neighborhoods in the developed world are middle-class neighborhoods, as most people who live in these parts of the world are just that: middle-class residents.

                         These are some pretty nice neighborhoods to hunt within. Whether they bend some towards upper class or lower class, they usually contain a fair amount of active, playful and curious children outdoors, with just fair parental supervision.

                         There's also a fair amount of dysfunctional families in there, which also gives you a fair amount of easy preys.

                         Thus, these neighborhoods do give you a fair chance of finding and taking down a nice little prey when hunting there. And they obviously put you right in the middle of the most wealthy and most poor areas, with a little bit of both regarding their properties, advantages and disadvantages.

                         What separates <u>these</u> kiddie hot-spots from all the others, is that they are very large arenas that have many different and potential hot-spots within them, which are less predictable. So, it doesn't make all that sense, nor does it sound practical, having just one stakeout point to get a decent overview.

                         Unless of course, there's a large hill nearby and you have a nice pair of powerful binoculars or a telescope on a tripod, which actually <u>can</u> give you a nice and safe overview after all.

                         Spotting for preys within neighborhoods does usually require a whole different sort of spotting, which means either using your car or your legs to carefully roam around and look for children. It will therefore be a way more active and exciting sort of spotting, but also way more apparent and easily noticeable by the local residents.

                         If you haven't already done so during your preparations, or at least not thoroughly enough, first use some decent time to <u>discreetly</u> learn to know your selected neighborhood better.

                         Use a detailed map of the area and/or drive or walk through it, while generally looking out for both kids and kiddie hot-spots.

                         As soon as you feel comfortable with your selected neighborhood, and you know its layout well, it'll be all about moving around and looking for children in a discreet manner.

                         A nice thing about neighborhood spotting, is that when you do see children out in the streets, they're usually very close to their homes. So, if you spot an interesting prey, you will most likely find it around the same area later.

                         Many kids will of course be spotted on their own lots as well. Then you will know for sure where they live, which is a great advantage and starting point for any further or future stalking of those particular children.

                                   When searching for preys while being right in the middle of their territory, and among the preys themselves, especially when using a dog, things may go a lot faster that you appreciate and feel comfortable with. Thus now, you may end up getting more than you actually bargained for.

                                   Thus, you may want to figure out, in advance, how to handle such situations if they should happen:
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Actually, there aren't that many alternatives. But regardless of what you do, this is actually a very positive thing to happen.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Because, I can start by telling you that you actually don't have to do anything special, other than being nice and polite towards them. And just leave it with that, if you want.

                                   I would've engaged a nice conversation with the curious kid, like asked about her name; and then told her mine, and optionally my dogs name. I would've asked her if she lives in this beautiful neighborhood, and then told her that I'm only visiting to meet friendly people, like her. And I would've answered all of her curious questions in a best possible way, <u>without</u> revealing my true intension nor identity of course.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Such situations will depend a lot on the circumstances too, like if you're alone with the child or there are other adults nearby. With other adults nearby, I would probably have been as verbally restricted as possible, but still friendly though.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Or, you can exploit this opportunity fully, if it's safe to do so, and go straight for the kill; I mean, the establishment of a potential relationship. You will quickly notice if the child is a contact or adult seeking child, or not. And if so, this would be a very easy and convenient opportunity to create a contact to meet up with later; or take along with you, into the woods, immediately, to get to know each other better(!).
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   But only interact with children within your own comfort zone. Never do anything spontaneous nor anything that hasn't any solid plan to stand on; unless you're a professional.

                                   If you're a newbie, and this is one of your very first spotting sessions, I think it would be enough with just a quick chat, and then a friendly goodbye.

                         Depending on the size of the town or community you're in, there might be several neighborhoods around to hunt within. And if so, it could be a good idea to move through several neighborhoods, one by one, during one hunting session. This will make you more mobile and thus cause less attention, contrary to hanging around just one area for a longer amount of time. By spreading your spotting over a much larger area, more preys will become available too.

                         If you're fortunate to live in the warmer climates of the world, or at least having such nice times during summertime, beaches can be some wonderful and straightforward places to spot for kiddie preys.

                         Beaches aren't only to be found along exotic coast lines, but can also be found around local lakes in rural areas.

                         Thus wherever you live, there <u>should</u> be a beach somewhere not that far away from your home, which people use regularly for swimming and tanning during the warm periods.

                         If you don't have any beaches close by, or within a sensible distance, now would be a great time to actually select a hunting location in those warm climate areas.
                         
                         <br />

                         Like shopping malls and neighborhoods, and some sports fields actually, you don't have to use a stakeout point from a distance. You can just take on your swimming shorts, place a blanket or a nice beach chair on the sand, with some cold beers in a cooling bag, and simply spot for kiddie preys in the most convenient, comfortable and lazy setting ever.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If the beach has a decent size and is decently populated, neither will you be restricted to just one beach spot. You will then be free to move all around the beach and water, without attracting any significant attention, and be able to come very close to your preys of interest.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And if all this wasn't enough, your preys will be all around you, in light and sexy swimming suits; some even all nude.

                         Children of all ages and both genders are to be found there. And many of the older children and young teens will travel to these beaches all alone, while many of these beaches have pretty remote roads and paths leading to them.

                         All this make beaches quite special kiddie hot-spots.

                         The only major drawbacks with beaches is first of all that they do require nice weather; they will be mostly active and best suited for kiddie hunting when the skies are clear and the air is hot. Second, kids who travel there all alone are usually traveling in groups, thus making it more challenging and less likely to take down just one prey nearby.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Set off a whole day, ideally in the weekend and when it's very hot, and go to your selected beach.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Get there early in the morning, so you can much easier select a convenient and comfortable place for the spotting.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such a place should have some distance to the waterline, ideally at a slightly higher elevation than the rest of the beach; it's important to have a decent overview of the beach.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Always remember to use a sunscreen with the highest possible protection factor, while drinking a lot of water, as you may be spending many hours in the sun.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, don't bring too much along with you. When your spotted prey decides to leave the beach, it won't be a good idea to have a ton of props to pack before you move.
                                        
                         <br />

                         Just like playgrounds, beaches are also unstable and unpredictable, as in having random visitors at random days during the warm periods. Thus, quick decisions have to be made when it comes to selecting preys, as you won't be able to e.g. monitor a certain prey predictably over several days.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         People tend to stay at the beaches for pretty long times too. So, if you spot a prey in the early hours of the day, you will most likely have to stay there for a pretty long while yourself before you can begin stalking her or him. But this doesn't have to be all that negative, as it <u>will</u> give you the opportunity to study your selected prey <u>very</u> thoroughly before any final decisions are made, which is a great thing with beaches.

                                   Even though all public beaches are free for everyone, and do contain a lot of single people being there to enjoy everything a beach is all about, you will still have to be at least <u>some</u> careful about how you act and what you do during your visit.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   Several beaches, especially the largest ones in tourist areas, have lifeguards. These lifeguards aren't only there to look for and rescue drowning people, but also look for e.g. suspicious activities on the beach itself. They're fully aware of pedophiles, and also the kidnapping of children.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   I therefore recommend to only perform <u>spotting</u> at beaches, regardless of size and human activity. Unless of course, the beach is very big and you really know what you're doing.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   It's additionally wise to be careful about not moving too much around the beach. Try to stick between your selected beach spot and some short swims. When you feel like moving around, do it as quietly and anonymously as possible, and only short strays each time.

                                   Avoid bringing cameras and binoculars along. Many people do have cameras, but mostly families. A single guy with a camera and a pair of binoculars will very likely attract negative attention towards himself.

                         When you do see some interesting and tempting preys, you may want to take a closer look. You may want to see their faces better, to better judge their looks. Or, just pass by them closely because it simply turns you on.

                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, you can always take some innocent and short strays, and pass them closely. But do this as few times as possible during one day or session, and only once per prey.

                         Other than this, the whole day will be all about watching and spotting for preys, while enjoying the nice environment.

                         Ops, I almost forgot: sunglasses are important; not only to protect your eyes, but also to be able to stare at children without having your head aimed straight towards them.

                         When your prey is about to leave the beach for that day, it will most likely warn you in advance, as it will most likely begin to pack and prepare to leave.

                         Many towns and communities have public pools. These pools are either outdoors or indoors, but mostly indoors.

                         Public pools are usually to be found in provinces with long distances to the beaches, making it a popular alternative for everyone who loves to swim and play in the water.

                         Public pools can be very nice hunting grounds for pedophiles to spot for preys of the older children and young teenagers.

                         Some pools do also have a bonus to offer the boy lovers, as you'll be sharing changing rooms and showers with same gender children. You will actually be close to nude children, while being nude yourself, for short periods during showers and/or changing. Though, not all pools offer this advantage, especially not the newest ones. You may therefore want to check several pools out, and see if you can find one of those old goodies with this old-school changing room design.

                         Public pools won't offer many distant stakeout points, but that's because you don't need any. You will obviously join all the kids in the pool and have fun swimming. Thus, you will now be very close and intimate with your potential preys.

                         Visiting a public pool is very easy for everyone, regardless of gender and age. You'll just have to meet up at the days when it offers free visitations and water play. Most likely you'll have to buy a pass or ticket to enter and use them, which is cheap.

                         Most will also have rubber hoods and goggles on, making their faces and looks really hard to judge.

                         This will also require some physical fitness, as it can become pretty exhausting doing long spotting sessions in the water.

                         But, like a warship or submarine, you can carefully swim around and get pretty close to potential preys, and do this many times without attracting negative attention. Though, don't get too close to them of course, neither stare into their eyes.

                                   Just like public beaches, most public pools do also contain lifeguards. Actually, there's almost a certainty that there will be at least one lifeguard watching each pool, as most regions in the developed world require it.

                                   Life guards at public pools will have a much better overview of the whole arena than lifeguards at public beaches, making it even easier to attract negative attention towards yourself if you're not careful or become too enthusiastic with your task.

                                   A trick used by many pedophile hunters at public pools is to masquerade their visits with a certain task, like doing timed swimmings from one end and to the other, ideally by using a waterproof timer or clock on their arms. This can also make some children notice you, causing them to contact you and ask what you're doing, and even cause them to suggest competing for fun, or that you time them as well. Such interactions would also draw less attention and be more acceptable among parents, lifeguards and other adults around. This can quickly lead to new relationships, especially if you visit the same pool at the same times, together.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Some pedophile pool hunters have also used the breath-holding activity, as in trying to hold your breath under water for as long as possible. This has also attracted curious kids.

                         When your selected prey exists the pool, stay in the pool for 30-60 seconds or so before you exit yourself and follow your prey into the wardrobe. It's important to make it <u>less</u> obvious that you're spotting for and stalking kids.

                         If your selected prey is of the opposite gender, you may exit the pool simultaneously. And then try showering and changing as fast as possible, so you get out of the hall first.

                         When you finally spot a suitable prey at a preferred hot-spot, it is time to start stalking it.

                         This won't be that important to do right away if you've spotted a prey at a predictable and recurring kiddie hot-spot, like an elementary school. Because then you will know that the child will return the next day. But even at these hot-spots, you will sooner or later <u>have</u> to start stalking your selected prey.

                         If you've spotted a prey at an unpredictable kiddie hot-spot, like a play ground or shopping mall, stalking will have to be initiated right away if you ever want to see your prey again.

                         The purpose of stalking children around is primarily to learn as much as possible about your prey. The more you know about it, like where it lives, what its regular routines are, what roads and paths it usually travel on, and where it likes to hang out, the easier it will be to find the right place and time to take it down; as in deciding if or when to safely approach and contact the child for the first time, at which location and spot.

                         Stalking kids around is also an <u>extremely</u> exciting task to do as a pedophile kiddie hunter. It will make your adrenaline pump through your veins, and make the sexual tension inside yourself increase to new levels.

                         If you're a little bit unsure about stalking children at this point, why not practice some in advance? This is actually so fun to do, even if you're not stalking any specific preys. You may just find a random child anywhere, and then start stalking it, just to feel how it's like and to gain some experience.

                         Finding your prey's home is the most important thing you can do as a kiddie hunter. It will be extremely advantageous, as it will allow you to monitor its further movements and routines, conveniently at a stable source. And if you ever loose your prey during any future stalking, you will know where to find it.

                         Of course, you may have chosen a certain hunting location, like a neighborhood, that has provided you with your prey's home immediately. And in those cases, the prey's home will obviously be your starting point for any future stalking anyway.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as you find your prey's home, it would be best to locate a new stakeout point in that area, so you can safely and comfortably monitor its home from a distance.

                         Distant stakeout points for monitoring houses can be hard to find in the average neighborhood, mostly because the terrain is very flat with many houses around. They can become especially hard to find within large and dense neighborhoods. Not to mention, it's easy to be spotted as a stranger as well.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Some kind of camouflage or stealth is usually required. And the best way to go about this is to either use or rent a minivan with dark rear windows, like I recommended when monitoring elementary schools. Or, you can use the nearest hill with a pair of powerful binoculars, or even a telescope.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If your prey lives in an apartment building, things become a lot easier. Now you can just monitor the main entrance to the building to see when the child leaves. And most apartment buildings have parking lots nearby where you can safely park and monitor, from any type of car. There are usually some benches around to sit on as well, like with a newspaper. Or, you can repeatedly pass the entrance with your dog, indefinitely, with the excuse that the dog has diarrhea.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If your prey lives up in the countryside, with some distance between the houses, finding a stakeout point should be a piece of cake. Such areas are usually covered by woods.

                         All families and their kids have regular routines, like clockwork. Thus, your main task when monitoring your prey's home, should be to learn all about these routines.

                         Your prey will wake up at specific times each morning, probably the same time everyday. It will then go to either preschool or school, either being transported by a parent or commuting with a bus, bicycle, or by foot.

                         If your prey commutes with a bicycle or by foot, it will use regular roads and paths that go between home and school.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It may play outside in its backyard or at its front drive. It may hook up with some friends at <u>their</u> homes, or meet up at some sort of a playground or play site; maybe building a tree hut at a secret place in the woods? It may bicycle to a local sports field for various ball practice, at regular days and times.
                         
                         <br />

                         Or, it may play around outdoors all alone, even play at secret locations far away from other adults and staring eyes. You may have found a <span class="glow_yellow">special child</span> whom is lonely and friendless.

                         All this will depend a lot on how much time you got available for such stalking and monitoring. The more time and patience you got for this task, the more you will learn about your preys, and the quicker this process will go in general.

                         If you are a busy person with not so much excess time for stalking preys, don't worry. As long as you know what school your prey goes to, or where it lives, you will just have to use more sessions and be more patient to succeed; which you will do anyway if you have done a good job with spotting a perfect prey, or have just been lucky with your choice.

                                   <li>Where and how does the child commute to school?</li>
                                   <li>Does the child have regular after-school activities?</li>

                                   <li>Does the child have friends, or is it lonely?</li>

                                   <li>Is the child a loved child, or is it unloved?</li>
                                   <li>When and where is the child all alone?</li>
                                   <li>Can you contact it <u>somewhere</u> without being seen?</li>
                                   <li>Is the child a good prostitution candidate?</li>

                         And those answers will tell you how <u>ideal</u> your prey is:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         An ideal prey would be a child who can be repeatedly approached and contacted alone, without you being seen, while having enough time to create trust and friendship.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         An even more idea prey would be a child who's <u>also</u> often alone, and/or poor in regards to economy and/or adult care.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It would be a super ideal prey if it has a secret play site where it plays alone, a play site that is discreet and private.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A prey becomes less ideal if it can only or mostly be contacted safely while being among friends; but still ideal enough to try out if you find it especially attractive.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A prey should generally be avoided if it's driven to school by their parents or a school bus everyday, and also driven to all other friends and free time activities. And a child who's rarely outdoors playing, while being very loved and protected.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>Unless</u>, you study it thoroughly enough to find a security hole in that family's security and care policy, which many hunters have actually found with lots of time and patience spent during their stalking, especially the more experienced hunters.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finding an ideal prey can become a challenge. Several of the children you end up stalking, will end up as dead ends, as in discovering that there's no sane way to contact them while staying anonymous and safe. Thus, multiple stakeouts and stalkings is usually required to find an ideal child love candidate and spouse. And sometimes, it can be many trials and errors before you finally strike gold.

                         <br />
                         
                         Your success rate will be low as a beginner. This is just a common fact that regards most other hunting sports in the world. But as soon as you gain experience as a hunter, and especially within spotting, as in finding ideal preys as early as possible, your success rate will shoot to the skies.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Patience is the name of the game, and practice is required. The more time you spend hunting for children, the faster you will move from a newbie to a professional.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You <u>will</u> find a perfect prey eventually, it's only a matter of time and experience. So hang in there, and don't give up if this seems challenging when trying it out for the first time.

                         Stalking children around without getting detected by the children themselves nor the general public, is actually much easier and safer than it sounds like.

                         However, it <u>does</u> require some basic theoretical education before it can be safely practiced in the field.

                         <br />
                         
                         Those of you who've chosen an elementary school as your hunting location, or any similar institution or activity center, may have to follow a child who uses a school bus to get home, or any other dedicated road transportation.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will thus need to follow a school bus around, and look out for your prey at every stop along its route.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When your prey finally gets off, it will be quite close to home, and you have succeeded the task.
                         
                         <br />

                         This is the most technically tricky way of stalking kiddie preys, but fully doable when doing it in the right way, along with carefulness and patience. It is also very exciting and pleasing, and it will become very rewarding in the end when you finally succeed a task of such a challenge.

                         You may want to practice some first with regular public buses, to get an idea about how this will turn out, before you actually go about the school bus of your selected prey.

                         However, <u>before</u> you start stalking school buses around, first see if the routes of the school buses in your area are publicly listed and available for you to obtain <u>anonymously</u>. This will make such stalkings way easier and more convenient to do.

                         Start by parking your car at a decent distance from the school sometime before the school ends. The longer the distance, the better it is; you don't want to attract any unwanted attention by staying to close to the school building while monitoring it.

                         These buses go slow, so it shouldn't be hard to catch up.

                         If you ever experience loosing a school bus, like ending up at a red light or anything, you will then know its <u>partial</u> route. Thus, the next day or session when you try again, just park your car somewhere along <u>that</u> road, and the bus should predictably and conveniently come from behind and pass by. You will then end up behind it, once again.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Also note that most school buses have a specific name or number on them that represents their regular routes. Your prey will always choose the same bus with the same route when going home, making it wise to remember such labels to recognize a particular bus among several similar buses.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you get behind the bus, try to keep a decent distance. This is important so it doesn't become apparent that you're following it, as you will most likely have to follow it a few times.

                         Bus drivers are very observant and look often in their mirrors!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Stay calm and don't be afraid of loosing it, as you'll have many new opportunities to repeat this action if you do loose it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         The bus will obviously stop at several bus stops to let some children off. And here comes the big challenge of stalking school buses, which will require lots of patience and practice:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is when the distance to the bus is yet again important; because if you got a long distance to it when it stops, you will be able to see who gets out during the time you approach it. And if you time this well, while having some luck on your side, the bus will start moving again <u>before</u> you pass it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And the larger and faster the road you're traveling at, the longer distance is required for this to succeed, while the stalking itself becomes generally harder.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If your selected prey didn't get off at the first stop, you will still be behind the bus, while adding some important distance once again, and repeating this trick at every bus stop.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Your prey should be easy to spot from a distance, because of its unique clothings and backpack.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A nice thing about certain school buses and their regions, is that when they stop, you're not allowed to pass by them, as a safety rule. You'll be forced to wait behind it until it moves again, leaving you with a huge advantage during this stalking.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as you see where your selected prey gets off, carefully notice which bus stop it is, and then abort your stalking and drive away.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may then continue stalking your prey the next day or session from that bus stop, which is usually done by foot.

                                   School buses, and similar dedicated kiddie transportations, are extremely sensitive objects to follow. Their drivers are usually very careful and observant, along with any possible bystander, thus anyone may note down your number plates if your driving becomes especially suspicious in this regard.

                                   Always keep the longest distance possible between you and the transportation objects.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   If a school bus stalking gets complex and demands several repetitions, or if the bus route is very long, you should consider splitting the stalking over several days, ideally with a couple of days between each stalking session. This will create some diversity, thus avoid creating a suspicious pattern.

                                   Remember that your car can very easily identify you through it's number plates. You may want to read through the upcoming sections about not using cars, as they contain some interesting and more secure alternatives.

                                   Several pedophiles have actually crashed their cars during this type of stalking. It's too easy to look more at buses and children than the road itself, and all other people around. So please be careful and observant, and keep this warning in mind when performing such complex stalkings. Stay safe as a driver, both towards yourself and everyone around you.

                         It may seem like a total no-go to follow school buses around without using a car yourself. But it <u>can</u> actually be done, as it has been successfully done several times.

                         Because, some of you may not own a car, or you may think that it's way too insecure using an easily identifiable car to stalk sensitive objects like school buses around.

                         Though, the success of doing this without a car will depend a lot on the location and how fast the bus go on average.

                         One alternative to using a car, is using a bike; and using it in the same way as described above with cars.

                         By using a bike, I don't mean using jeans and a leather jacket on your grandmothers bike. By using a bike, I mean using at least a semiprofessional looking biking suite on a semiprofessional looking bike. This will turn you into an advanced biker, which will become an important camouflage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You'll only need to <u>look</u> professional, not become a real one, so this doesn't have to become all that expensive.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, it will always be advantageous being in a decent physical shape and having a generally decent bike, which together will give you both endurance and decent speeds, which again will make this alternative method more plausible.
                                                  
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A bike will give you way more control over the stalking and whole situation in general, contrary to a car; because it allows you to innocently stop every time the bus stops somewhere ahead of you to let off children. Your excuse for stopping can be taking breaks, drinking from your water bottle, or tinkling some with the bike; all of which are very little suspicious, especially with a decent distance to the bus.
                                        
                         <br />

                         You may attract some attention if you got a very nice bike with very nice gear; but a bike doesn't have a number plate on it, and you can better conceal your looks by using a biking helmet and sunglasses. Most people won't look at professional looking cyclists as pedophiles who are stalking school buses anyway, because that's just too crazy, or what?

                         By the way: there are actually special bikes nowadays that come with on-board electric motors. Such bikes can become pretty expensive, but they will surely  make this method much easier and less physically hard to accomplish.

                         If not being able to use cars <u>nor</u> pedal bikes, following school buses around may seem <u>absolutely</u> impossible. Or, is it?

                                   A long time ago, on the ancient Usenet, there was a pedophile who had found a <span class="glow_yellow">special child</span>, by monitoring an elementary school, whom where simply too good to be true. But the lovely little creature used a school bus every single day to get home, thus he could never really approach her and make contact.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   He didn't own a car, nor did he have a drivers license. He also suffered from diabetes, thus he didn't have the health to safely use a semi-pro bike to follow the bus around. 
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   So, when I suggested sequential mapping to find out where the kid was living, people where actually laughing at me.

                                   <u>Until</u>, they guy actually tried it, and finally succeeded!

                         Nothing is really impossible, as long as you're motivated and dedicated enough to succeed.

                         Sequential mapping will require a huge amount of patience, but in return it will make the impossible possible:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will need to draw a line on a map, either inside your own head or on a local paper map, that represents the route of the school bus along with its stops. And you will have to do this by spotting the bus <u>sequentially</u> as it moves through its route.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The first sequence will be the starting point of the bus, and how far it goes until you can't see it anymore from the place you're monitoring it from.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The second sequence will start either at the point of where you last saw the bus disappear, or right before the first road intersection from that point. The latter trick can actually cover pretty long distances per sequence, as the bus can only drive in one particular direction, and not be able to fly away.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The third, and all the next sequences, will continue like this, until you actually have the whole route of the bus drawn.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Each sequence represents a whole day, meaning that you can only do 5 or 6 sequences during one week.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When you finally know the whole route, you will also know where all the bus stops are, at least eventually. From there you can monitor each stop, ideally from a distance, everyday when the bus drives through its regular route.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Eventually, you will find the stop where your prey gets off!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Exploit high terrain levels, so you can see larger portions of the route, and where the school bus goes and stops.

                         This method may sound crazy, but it actually works. And there are few rewards in life that match the feeling of actually successfully completing a task that initially was never meant to be succeeded.

                         How far you choose to go to follow a school bus around, will most likely depend on your spotted prey:

                         &#160;

                         If you spot a very attractive and ideal prey, like a <span class="glow_yellow">special child</span>, you may want to do anything possible to follow that child's school bus. Because that child will very likely become a short or longterm sexual partner of yours, thus worth fighting for.

                         Or, you may do it because it is so exciting and fun, like being inside an enormous adventure game with some hard challenges to overcome and master.

                         Just don't give up if you think this is very challenging at first. Patience and practice, along with carefulness and stealth, are the <u>keys</u> to succeed with school bus stalkings.

                         One day, you may find a very attractive child and suitable prey that you want to stalk. But the child is either picked up by someone in a car, or follows someone into one. And this can happen at any hunting location.

                         Now you'll be forced to actually follow their car to be able to learn where the child lives.

                         And using a car yourself will now be <u>crucial</u> for success.

                         You are of course free to try using alternative transportations, as already <a class="set3" href="#link1" target="_blank">covered</a> within the School Bus section. But cars usually go a lot faster and longer than local school buses do, while usually not having the same amount of predictability. Thus, using any other alternatives to a car may make it extremely challenging to succeed.

                         However, there <u>is</u> a way around car stalkings, which I will go through later in this section.

                         This kind of stalking will be very much like the stalking that private investigators regularly do. And there's really no rocket science to it, you just got to stay cool and concentrated while following some basic rules.

                         You may want to practice some on this first, by following several random cars around. This will give you an idea about what you'll be up against, while it will provide you with some practice and experience in advance of any <u>real</u> car stalk.

                         The starting point of car stalking depends on what hunting location you're using:

                         If you're using an Elementary School, or anything similar, you will most likely know when and where the child is being picked up by the car. You can then park your car somewhere behind that spot, with the engine running, and ideally from a decent distance. And as soon as the car with the child begins to move, count 3-5 seconds, and then start to move yourself.

                         Such places may have large parking lots, or even several large. They may also have indoor or basement car parkings. And your car may be far away from your prey's car.

                         However, when adults are having children along with them when using cars, they usually need some time to strap up the kids and install any merchandises. As long as there's no fire anywhere, they won't rush things as badly as <u>you</u> will have to do to get to <u>your</u> car before they leave the arena.

                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as you see their car, remember it's make and color, and then run for your own.
                         
                         <br />

                         It's always a good idea to be prepared for this when you park your car at such locations. Thus, park your car close to the parking lots exits.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If there's only one shared main entrance and exit to the parking lot of your hunting ground, all you need to do is to wait in your car until the prey's car come along and exits.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If there are multiple exits, and the prey's car will exit another place, you will just have to move to that part of the area while crossing your fingers. Thus, it's also wise to become familiar with such places before hunting there, in case something like this should happen.

                         When finally being on the road, and you're behind them, the distance is crucial:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In the more dense areas, with some decent traffic around, stay behind them with a distance of like having a couple of cars between the two of you. The best situation is to actually <u>have</u> a couple of other cars between the two of you, which takes some timing and practice to accomplish successfully.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the area is less dense, or very deserted and open, with long roads ahead of you, an even longer distance will be required to stay undetected. But such areas should <u>allow</u> for longer distances anyway, without loosing them that easily.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're on multiple lanes, like on a highway or in a big city, and the prey's car is changing lanes, only change to the same lane yourself in the last second before the road splits.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They may also stop along the road, either at gas stations or even more stores, which isn't unusual for families do to.
                         
                         <br />

                         You will then have to make a split decision:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Your may stop at the same places as they do. This would be the easiest option, but also increase the risk of detection, especially if the places they stop at are less populated.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Or you may pass them and continue down the same direction, but stop and wait for them at a discreet location further down. And then, carefully pick up the stalking when they (hopefully) continue driving down the same direction and pass you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If they stop and park alongside the road within a town or city, it's usually wise to pass them and park in front of them instead of behind them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Another challenge is toll roads. They may have a pass, so they can speed through it; but <u>you</u> will have to stop and buy a ticket to go through, and then speed up to catch up with them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, keep in mind that it is much harder stalking in the dark.

                         Most people who follow cars around are afraid of detection. But we're now talking about the average parent in an average stressed weekday, not a cautious government agent or a drug dealer. The average person does rarely think about stalkings by other cars. When was the last time you thought about that yourself, when driving to e.g. work? Some might be paranoid of course, but those are also rare.

                         <br />
                         
                         If you ever should get a sense of detection, like if they should look often in their mirrors and turn their heads around, just abort the stalking. Most will then think that they where just paranoid, and that there's nothing to worry about after all.

                         If you succeed, you will <u>finally</u> end up at their home. You can then note the address quickly, and then disappear for now.

                         There's an alternate way to stalk cars with your preys in them, which is to note down their registration plate numbers.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It's possible in many countries to look up names and addresses from car registration plate numbers. This is a very easy and effortless way to find these preys homes.

                         <br />
                         
                         The only problem with this method is that in some areas, civilians don't have access to this info. And in other areas you may have access, but you will have to pay for the service, which will reveal your true ID and thus make it <u>very</u> dangerous pursuing the prey who's related to that particular car.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you can buy this info through an cellphone SMS, you may use an anonymous and prepaid cellphone to pay for the info.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, there are some areas that allow you to search for this info both legally and anonymously on the Internet, like when using Tor, which will instantly give you the name and address of the car's owner. And this will obviously be much better than stalking the car itself.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, before you start stalking cars around, check if you live in an area that allows you to do free and anonymous lookups of car registration plate numbers. Unless, you want to stalk cars regardless, because it really is exciting to do.

                         Those of you who've chosen an elementary school as your hunting location, or any similar institution or activity center, may have to follow a child who uses a school bus to get home, or any other dedicated road transportation.

                         But, not all regions of our world use dedicated school buses to transport children. Several regions actually use regular and public buses instead, or other public transportation services, which you and everyone else can use as well as the children.

                         Public transportation services are generally used by children all the time, and isn't limited to schools and similar only. Especially the older children and young teens in urban areas use public transportation regularly to move around.

                         I will now use a bus as the main sample for a public transportation service, but it can be any other service really.

                         If you know what bus a spotted prey regularly uses each day, wait for that bus one or two stops after the child enters.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When you enter the bus, you should see the child in one of the seats. But never look at the child directly, only in your side view. Pretend that the child doesn't exist. And try, if possible, to get a seat or standing position somewhere <u>behind</u> the child in the bus, so you'll easily see where the child gets off.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If this is a child on its way home from school, or a child on any regular and everyday route, don't exit along with the child when it gets to its stop. Just note that stop, and then exit at the next stop after that, or at any other stop for that matter. Because your task has actually been completed already, as you now know where the child went off the bus, thus you now know its regular stop.
                         
                         <br />

                         If this is a random child that you've spotted at e.g. a shopping mall or at any other public arena, this bus will obviously not be a regular route that the child takes everyday. Thus, you will then be forced to get off at the same stop as the child does, to further follow it wherever it continues by foot.

                         And here comes a delicate part that needs some attention:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child is the only one who goes off the bus at that particular stop, it may look a little bit suspicious that you get up right after the child does, and goes off at the same stop. It's not like anyone can do anything about it, as this is a public service in the first place; but this might be the time when some people notice you, and thus becoming quite able to describe you later if anything should go wrong with that child.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also end up at this buss top all alone with the child, thus also be clearly noticed by the child itself. This can make it harder to continue stalking it by foot, especially if the child is cautious and intelligent by nature.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is especially delicate if this is a small transportation service in a small town or community. However, not a significant problem in larger and more dense areas, with much more going on around the both of you.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's important that you remind yourself that you haven't done anything wrong at this point, so there's nothing to <u>really</u> worry about. But as you may see, you're now getting way closer to the heat than ever before, which will cause challenges for inexperienced hunters.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         From now and on, you'll be stalking the child by foot, which we will go through in a moment.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Unless of course, the child makes contact and starts talking to you after having left the bus together; something which has surprised many hunters during this part of the stalking. And lots of things can happen from there.

                         Many children use bikes to get around. It's a very effective way for them to travel to like schools and friends, or any hangout they may have and like visiting.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But following children who use bikes can actually be a real challenge. They will go too slow to be followed by cars, and some will go too fast to be followed by foot.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With a car, it will be very challenging to follow them around without attracting unwanted attention from the child itself and the general public. You will need to drive very slow to successfully stalk the kid, and way slower than what's normal, which will be very obvious and suspicious.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This way of stalking can quickly mark you as a dangerous predator in that area, which isn't good for your hunting at all.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Even if you do somehow succeed by using a car, the child may at any time spontaneously turn off the public road and continue into a much smaller road or path, as a part of its regular route, where you simply can't go with any car
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It doesn't get any easier by foot, as the average kid can get some decent speeds on a bike, especially downhill.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, by either becoming or pretending to be a runner, while using some decent running gear, it may become possible to follow biking kids around by foot, especially the younger children on routes that are either very flat or have more uphills than downhills.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Unfortunately, it can quickly fail as soon as they flee downhill somewhere, and disappear.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The most efficient way to follow biking kids, and generally the <u>only</u> way if you want to be sure not to loose your selected prey, is to either become or pretend being a cyclist; while of course using some decent and suitable gear.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This <u>will</u> however require having a bike along with you when hunting, which obviously makes your hunting more advanced and complicated; but still is a much used method among pedophiles who have found themselves biking preys at stable and predictable kiddie hot-spots, like elementary schools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Whether you'll be running or cycling, it <u>will</u> require that you're in a basically decent physical shape, and that you're ready to <u>work</u> some to follow your prey around.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, using professional looking gear is <u>required</u>, as this will give you a <u>reason</u> for being there and doing what you're doing. Otherwise, both your prey and everyone else around may question your motives.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You'll only need to <u>look</u> like a professional, not become a real one, so this doesn't have to become all that expensive.
                        
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Having a dog along with you while running, who's also in a decent physical shape, may additionally help you looking even less suspicious and threatening on foot.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most children will less likely sense a professional looking <u>athlete</u> behind themselves as creepy and scary, and more likely freak out by having a slow moving vehicle constantly behind themselves, with a dark shadow inside.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         My personal recommendation is therefore to follow biking children around as either a runner or cyclist; a cyclist being the most efficient and foolproof choice.

                         Even though using a car to follow biking kids around isn't recommended, I will still teach you how to do it. As for some hunters, using a car is unavoidable of various reasons.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Previous attempts of such <u>have</u> actually ended successfully; but it <u>is</u> very challenging, with a slim likelihood of success. And it has to be done in a <u>very</u> careful and delicate way, so you don't attract any negative attention neither from the child nor the general public.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The <u>distance</u> is thus more important than any other stalking. Your car will produce sounds, so the further away you are to the child, the less likely it will notice you being behind it. Having a silent car is thus recommended, actually required.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Having a hybrid, like Toyota Prius, would be perfect for this!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The most successful way to do this is <b class="h">fragmented driving</b>:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         That means stopping your car along the roadside when you barely see the child in front of you, and carefully drive some when the child disappears from your view; but <u>only</u> until you can barely see the child again. And repeat this stop-start-stop method while keeping the longest distance possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Also keep an eye on the child itself: if it turns its head around several times and looks at you, then you're revealed, and it's game over. This can happen very easily, which just proves how difficult and vulnerable this method of stalking really is. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This method will only be doable within small to middle sized towns and community neighborhoods, as <u>they</u> will allow for continuous parking along the roadside. This won't work if the child travels alongside a busy road or highway.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, if you do find yourself on a busy road or highway, you will have to do <b class="h">sequential mapping</b> instead: 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Pass the child, but do whatever you can to stop somewhere down that road where it's possible, like at bus stops, shops, gas stations or road intersections, without attracting too much attention nor braking any traffic rules. Then wait for the child to pass you, and continue driving while repeating this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Try not to stop until the child is out of sight in your rear view mirror, and neither start driving again until you no longer can see it in front of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         Repeat this until the child no longer passes you again, and then drive back and try searching for the child by investigating any road intersection between that stop and your last, where the child could've turned into.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child stares at your car while you're doing this, like when you pass each other for like the third or fourth time, then it's also game over, as you've been revealed.

                         The child may also suddenly drive off and into the woods, like on a dirt road. And then you will also loose your prey.

                         If you're following a child whom bikes on a <u>regular</u> route, like biking home from school everyday, you may use a sequential mapping more similar that of mapping <a class="set3" href="#link2" target="_blank">school buses</a>.

                                   If you sense that the child may have noticed you, especially if the child freaks out and increases its speed, abort and drive home. And never go back to that hunting location ever again.

                                   I don't mean to be a bore, but the child will then most likely tell about it when it gets home, and even describe your car to some extent. If you then <u>continue</u> staying in that area for hunting, you may be doing that as a marked predator. And this won't be a good basis to build your Hunting Season upon. There are so many other places to hunt within, so don't risk anything by staying around these parts if you seem to have been revealed.

                                   If you get revealed for something like this, both the child and everyone else who learns about it will become very aware about someone stalking children around in <u>that</u> area. So, it neither helps much to leave your car behind and instead continue stalking children in that area by foot.

                                   The dangerous thing about using cars to stalk children on bikes, is that the children may notice you, but <u>not</u> apparently. So, you may end up being marked as a predator <u>without</u> being aware of it yourself; which often happens to newbie hunters, and can cause various negative surprises in the near future.

                         Stalking biking kids as a professional runner is the first of the two <u>recommended</u> methods, which fits young children on the slower routes that are mostly flat.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When being behind your prey, try as much as possible matching your prey's speed without making it too obvious; use long steps in a quick pace when you need to speed up, and use short steps with a lower pace to speed down. This trick will make you seem like running in a <u>constant</u> speed, when regularly changing between slow and fast speeds.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As a runner, you don't need to run all the time. You can walk some as well. So, if your prey ends up riding at very low speeds, or there are lots of uphills, simply switch to walking.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The distance will also be important now; have the greatest distances possible, as this will make you less obvious and give you a nice buffer when the child speeds down or stops.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Avoid stopping completely yourself, unless you know for sure that the child isn't especially aware about who's behind it. Pretend to take breaks if you really need to stop, and drink some from a water bottle. Ideally, pass the child instead, and then slow gradually down; the child will hopefully pass you later. But by passing it, you <u>will</u> make yourself more obvious.

                         Downhills are your biggest enemies as a runner, as kids can get some serious speeds when going downhill on bikes.

                         <br />
                         
                         If your prey ever disappears in front of you, whether being downhill or it just moves very fast in general, don't give up. Just continue running while switching equally between a high and medium pace, so you don't wear yourself out. The child might meet uphills, or generally ride slower further down its route. It may also stop for various reasons. Thus, you might catch up with it again, sooner or later.

                         Also be aware of intersections and side roads if loosing it.

                         As a runner, there aren't all that much you can do other than doing and trying your very best to follow your prey around, while being as discreet and stealthy as possible.

                         Stalking biking kids as a professional cyclist is the last of the two <u>recommended</u> methods, which fits older children and adolescents on the faster routes with several downhills.
                         
                         <br />

                         When using a bike, you will have very good control over the situation. You will be able to fully control the distance to your prey, and be able to travel at the same speeds, whatever speeds that turn out to be; as most average adults will be physically superior to most children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And keeping the longest distance possible still applies here, as it will make both yourself and your stalking less obvious.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just as with being a runner, the child may sometimes slow down to very low speeds. And these speeds can sometimes become so low that it will seem suspicious if you follow the same low speeds behind it. The child may even stop fully.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A trick that can be used to solve this problem, is to just pass the child with a decent speed yourself. The child will continue to travel from behind, so it won't disappear in thin air.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, as soon as you meet any sort of intersection, where the child <u>can</u> take two or more possible ways, stop some in front of it to take a break, or to tinker some on your bike.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         When the child finally comes and passes you, and you see where the child is now heading, wait 1-3 minutes before you carefully start to follow the child again, in the same way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Avoid using this trick too many times, like more than 3 times or so, as that may alert the child that something isn't right, especially the older children.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you need to do this many times, please appeal to your patience and consider doing it over several days instead of just one session. Ideally with a day or so in between. Which of course, will only be possible if this is a <u>regular</u> route.

                         The definitive best way to stalk kids around, is to follow them by foot while <u>they</u> are walking as well. You will then have so much control over the whole situation at so many levels.

                         There are however some differences with this type of stalking. I will therefore start by going through the differences between dense and subdued environments, and finally cover the differences between static and random preys:

                         <br />
                         
                         The easiest and most convenient environments for kiddie stalkings by foot, are dense and crowed environments with many people and much of activities around.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such environments are usually larger towns and cities, and all the roads and paths within them.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This is so easy and convenient because such environments are so easy to blend into and hide within, without needing any special outfits or props, while being able to stay pretty close to your preys without being easily detected nor revealed.

                         These are thus very nice entry-level kiddie stalking arenas for newbies to start stalking or just <u>practicing</u> within.

                         The distance isn't all that important when stalking children by foot in dense environments, especially not within big cities with lots of general activities all around. But it's always an advantage to keep at least <u>some</u> distance, in case your prey stops of various reasons, or is very observant in general.
                         
                         <br />

                         Some children will move pretty rapid and consistently, like when being on their way home or to any specific location. These are the easiest preys to stalk.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, many children who roam around in big cities, especially adolescent girls, do have a tendency to stop a lot, either for window shopping, real shopping, or stopping at cafeterias to hang out and buy sweets. So, it would be advantageous to have some backup plans if something like this happens during your stalking:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         By having a decent distance, you will have a buffer between you and your prey. So when it stops, you can just slow down, and your prey will hopefully start moving again as you approach it. Then increase the distance again and recreate this buffer, and redo this trick every time your prey halts.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If a buffer isn't enough when your prey stops temporarily to look at something, you can actually stop yourself and do the same thing, like if there's a shop with a window nearby. If the distance between you is great, your prey won't that easily notice that you stop every time she or he does.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, you can stop and look at some tourist brochures that you're carrying, and do this repeatedly every time your prey stops. Or, you may start fiddling with your cellphone or pretend to have a conversation on it. And change between similar tricks every time you have to stop.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If your prey enters a standard shop, it will probably not stay there for that long. You shouldn't follow preys inside shops anyway, as you don't want them to notice you several times. And the shops they enter may not be suitable for your person, making such visits look really odd. So, just wait outside for your prey to come out again, while watching the shop's entrance from a decent distance.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If your prey enters a large mall, you are free to follow it inside; which may be wise to do anyway, as large malls may have other exits that your prey may exit through. You may then want to follow the advices from the <a class="set3" href="#shopping_malls" target="_blank">Shopping Malls</a> section.

                         If your prey enters a cafeteria, it may end up staying there for an hour or longer. There you may enter as well, but not before 5-10 minutes <u>after</u> your prey entered. And try not to do this again during the rest of the stalking, so they don't notice you several times close by.

                         When stalking preys in quiet and calm environments, especially if there's only the two of you around, it will become much more challenging to successfully stalk your prey without being detected and freaking her or him out.

                         There have been many occasions of pedophile stalkers revealing themselves in such environments; and suddenly the children spin off and flee into the sunset, never to be seen again. Even the professionals experience this sometimes.

                         So, this will be like balancing on a knife's edge: there will be a very fine balance between loosing your prey and getting detected, with very little room for common newbie mistakes.

                                   These are the environments where being accompanied with a dog can make the important difference between succeeding and not succeeding, as in <u>succeeding</u>.

                                   With a dog, you will initially look next to nonthreatening. You will be able to move very slowly and stop several times on the way, without raising any suspicions; like letting the dog explore its current environment, or just crouching down and petting it some. You will even be able to run some, as in exercising or playing with the dog, without having to wear a pro running suit. 
                                   
                                   <br /><br />
                                   
                                   Of course, you will attract more attention with a dog, but this will be <u>positive</u> attention that's rarely anything to worry about.

                         Regardless of having a dog or not, try keeping the longest distance possible to your prey, ideally so long that you barely can see it ahead of you. Try keeping a fine balance between seeing the prey and not seeing it, and adjust your speed accordingly to keep it on the very edge of your horizon.

                         Luckily, most children who move by foot in subdued areas don't stop that much along their routes. Unless, we're talking about a cute little girl who strays in her own little world, stopping to pick up some flowers to smell on, and exploring this large and magical universe that she exists within.

                         Static preys are preys that walk on regular routes at regular days and times. These are the preys you will find when watching e.g. elementary schools and other static hot-spots.

                         Now you will know what roads and paths your preys start on, and what directions they move towards, which they do every single day, making them very easy and convenient to stalk.

                         Still keep the longest distance possible, regardless of the area and its density. Though, you will now feel way more confident if you loose a prey for short periods, as you can just pick up the stalking, where you lost it, the very next day.

                         Random preys are preys that walk irregular routes at irregular days and times, like the ones you find at e.g. shopping malls.

                         The only way to learn where these preys live, to ever be able to see them again, is to follow them <u>all</u> the way home, while only having just <u>one</u> chance of doing that.

                         A nice tip that regards all sorts of kiddie stalkings by foot, which has been practiced by lots of pedophiles for decades, is to take your jacket or sweater off an on regularly. It will then be much harder for your preys to notice and recognize the <u>same</u> person following them. But this will of course depend on the climate and temperature you're in.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Regardless of the circumstances, the younger the prey you're stalking, the least aware it will be about being stalked. Thus, the youngest preys are the easiest ones to stalk. And of course, the older and more mature preys will be the hardest ones to stalk with stealth and success.

                                   When this happens, the prey will most likely freak out and become afraid of you. This will almost certainly make it impossible for you to approach later, and it will most likely tell about it to its parents and friends as well.

But still probably not the best preys to continue stalking and approaching as a newbie though.

                                   it's simply not worth pushing the boundaries if you get detected, no matter how temping or perfect that prey is. There are so many other preys out there, even more perfect, just waiting to be spotted and stalked by you.

                                   I also recommend exiting the whole hunting location if this happens, just to be on the sure side; especially if this is a smaller town or community. There are so many other locations to choose from as well.

                         Stalking children preys who travel on foot is actually very exciting; It is real hunting in its true sense, and it is way more easier and secure than it may seem like.
