                         The question about having sex with children or not, is a question that most pedophiles will meet sooner or later in life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         For some, it will be an easy question, because some are very certain and confident about their decisions, whether the answer is yes or no. Others however, will feel an almost agony from not knowing what to do. And many of the latter, may also feel agony after having <u>made</u> their final choice.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In other words, this is a hugely complex question that obviously can't be answered by this chapter alone, but rather by the handbook as a whole. This chapter will only give you some initial advices and pointers, to better prepare you for making a final decision when that time finally comes.

                         <b>Crossing The Line</b>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         As you will later learn in the <b class="h">Security</b> guide of this handbook, there are several levels of child love practice to perform.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Each level is different in how child love is being practiced, all the way from light and legal practice, to heavy and illegal.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, there's a <u>line</u> within child love practice that separates legal practice from illegal practice; and you may look at this line as the basis for this question.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This question is thus really about: should I <u>cross</u> the line?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This line has a gray zone that represents all the different laws around the world for what is accepted and not as legal interactions with children. You will need to figure that gray zone out according to your own local laws, if you want to stay very close to it, and especially when pushing it some.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In other words, you can either stay safely behind this line and enjoy children as much as your local laws allow you to, or make a decision to cross it and thus lay your hands on those nude, warm and forbidden places on the children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Also note that pushing your child love practice towards this line, will also require a lot of self-discipline. The closer you are to this line, and the longer time you spend close to it, the easier it will be to cross it; which may not be the right choice for some of you at the end of the day.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="the_main_change"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <b>The Main Change</b>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you do choose to cross the line, which means practicing illegal child love with a child, as in having sex with it, an important consequence will be that <b class="h">main change</b> in your life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         I am calling it the main change because it is a change that is very hard for most people to completely go around and avoid, unless you are an extremely wealthy and/or powerful person.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And this change should really be an important part of your final decision; will you be able to handle and forever live this change in your life, or will you <u>not</u>?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         This main change is lie a coin; it has two different sides to it; one dark and one bright. And, you will have to deal with both of them after having crossed the line.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="the_dark_side"></a>

                         Well, let's start with the bad news first:

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>Everything</u> will change, first of all because you are suddenly doing something that is strictly socially unacceptable and illegal by law. And, since there will be a certain risk of getting caught, thus risk getting totally fucked by both the society and the law enforcement, a certain weight of fear will constantly hang over your shoulders, far into the future.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most of this fear will actually be based on your faith in your child and its ability and motivation to keep your sexual games and relationship a <u>secret</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         There are ways to make children keep secrets in very secure and comfortable ways, which will be thoroughly thought in the <b class="h">Security</b> guide of this handbook. But, even the best secrecy practice with children will never give you full control over the situation, because your sexual activities may at any day and any time become revealed <u>somehow</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Second, most people appreciate freedom and security, making one able to sleep well at nights and wake up happy in the morning, and just feel well about life in general. When you cross this line with a child for the first time, you might just discover how much you really appreciated this freedom and security, as it will suddenly become forever threatened.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Please note that most children from late toddlerhood and older will also detect these changes, potentially getting the same fears and challenges as yours,
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Third, guilt will always be a potential problem for all pedophiles who cross the line, especially among those who are close relatives to the kids whom they have sex with. And most aren't immune to such innocence, and those big and uncertain eyes that look at you. The adult may thus ask himself: am I hurting this child? Is this right of me to do, <u>really</u>?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Fourth, a role change will most likely occur within close family relationships. And, it can be a challenge having the roles of e.g. an authoritative father and a cool lover in the same time, especially if you're inexperienced; just like it will be hard for a child to be e.g. an obedient daughter and a cool lover in the same time. Such a role change may even confuse the child, which is why incest will always be way more crucial than non-incestuous sexual relationships.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, the latter problem may also affect other and similar authoritative relationships, like babysitters, daycare workers, and school teachers.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Finally, there is shame; shame towards doing something that's forbidden and socially despicable; and shame towards being different from the rest; all of which can affect both the adult and the child negatively, the child especially.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Such disturbances in life can have a negative impact on the lives of the both of you. And it can become such a disturbance that it will be hard to feel joy and happiness afterwards, like you did before you crossed the line.

                         The main change can feel overwhelming for the newbies. Most of them go through what I call the roller-coaster effect of pedophilia practice, which is feeling very good about it one day, but very bad the next; and keep on going back and forward, and up and own, on this roller-coaster. This can quickly lead to confusions, and even panic, among several.

                         <br />
                         
                         But, it's important to be aware that this roller-coaster ride will gradually flatten out with time. You will eventually get used to your new life situation and thus handle it much better in general. You don't even have to do anything special to accomplish that, as it will happen all by itself, simply by giving it enough time.

                         We humans are the species that is best at adapting to new environments and situations. So, just be patient and ride the storm off, and the sun will eventually come back; and so will the calm waters.

                         <br />

                         This is exactly why it is so important not to panic after having just started out practicing sex with children. Give it <u>time</u>!

                         <br />

                         The most important part of the bright side is the fact that you will actually be making love to children, which should <u>not</u> be taken lightly. You will for the first time in your life be able to actually practice your sexual orientation and have sex with real children, which will give you insane pleasures, relives and rewards on so many levels. You will experience a sexual excitement that no drug on earth can even begin comparing itself to. You will be living your life to the fullest extent and feel like finally becoming a complete human being. You will be saying 'up yours' to the whole society and law enforcement, and finally be able to raise from the suppression and tyranny from everyone who's against such practice and is fighting us; and raise far above all of them. This will give you the best feelings and highs you've ever experienced as a human.

                         Most teleiophiles, and even some pedophiles who are highly conservative, question the rightfulness of putting pedophilia into practice. Some are even questioning the rightfulness of actually <u>being</u> a pedophile in the first place.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And this is just yet another important factor to consider when answering this very important question.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The main favorite argument against pedophilia and putting it into practice, is that pedophilia has been officially classified as a mental illness by the WHO (World Health Organization). This means that officially and legally, pedophilia is a mental illness, thus practicing it becomes wrong and harmful, seen from the eyes of the antis.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This argument leads to another popular argument against pedophilia, saying that genuine pedophiles aren't naturally reproductive because they exclusively want to reproduce with sexually immature children, not similarly aged adults.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         I am not going to try convincing the antis that pedophilia is harmless to practice, neither am I going to pretend being fully objective about the matter. But I <u>am</u> going to express some facts and opinions that may put things in a different perspective for everyone who dare to think outside the box, thus think differently than the sheep herd of the society and the slaves of the (inter)governmental organizations.

                         Pedophiles can function just as well as any teleiophile, being both intelligent and successful within social groups, schools and careers. You cannot spot pedophiles in large groups of people by the way they generally behave and function in the society, neither can you scientifically diagnose pedophilia by using any instrument or test within medicine or psychology.

                         Yes, there are pedophiles who live outside what you may call a normal life, as in being loners who both prefer to and do spend a lot of time with children. But, so do may teleiophiles as well, of several different reasons.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Sure, pedophiles want to have sex with children, but so will many teleiophiles too, even average homosexuals.
                         
                         <br />

                         Calling pedophilia a mental illness is scientifically incorrect, and should have been officially changed to a sexual orientation by the WHO. Because, pedophilia is not about being sick, is is just about having a different <u>preference</u>.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So why <u>do</u> they call pedophilia a mental illness?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Did you know that prior to and throughout most of the 20th century, <u>common</u> and <u>official</u> psychology classified homosexuality as a mental illness? It is true, just look it up. But <u>one</u> day, someone decided to change that, and officially make homosexuality a sexual orientation instead.

                         You see, these issues are being handled accordingly to the current culture and what's convenient in a society:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The human culture <u>changed</u>, so homosexuals where thus labeled differently.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Since the sheep herd, I mean the majority of people in our society, has been brainwashed to hate pedophilia since childhood, it is <u>convenient</u> labeling pedophilia as an illness; just as it was convenient labeling skeptics and scientists as heretics in the ancient days, and burn them alive on bonfires with cheering crowds of both adults and children.

                         Just take a look at the human history, and you will quickly see an unfortunate behavior pattern within the average human culture and society, that still is a reality as of <u>today</u>.

                         Actually, in ancient days, pedophilia was quite common. Adults and children even got married. Children could even be found and bought at whorehouses. But, if you where a scientist back then who questioned God, then you became hunted down, tortured and killed.

                         When the church lost power sometime later, the gays where next in line to be suppressed and killed. And when the society lost power over the gays, the <u>pedophiles</u> came next.

                         The pedophilia hysteria began for real during the latter 80s and early 90s. Parents where sent to jail for taking natural pictures of their children playing in underwear, or while playing with rubber ducks in bathtubs. There where pedophiles <u>everywhere</u> back then; behind every bush, tree and pole; as most people back then thought and feared.

                         While the pedophiles still are some feared and suppressed as of today, terrorists and weapons of mass-destruction seems to be the next logical step to take from here, I suppose. What else is there to hunt down and kill, when they <u>finally</u> understand that children can actually have positive experiences from sexual play and education with adults?

                         The pedophiles aren't the ones being really messed up here, it is the sheep herd of our society that is. The whole human society is messed up, has always been that, and still is today.

                         Dear pedophiles, you're <u>not</u> mentally ill. You're just <u>different</u>. But the human society has proven through its history that being different, being a minority, is a magnet for fear, hate and suppression. And that's about it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         That is why WHO, along with their anti-pedophile psychiatrists, have classified pedophilia as a mental illness.

                         <br />

                         Then we get to the 'inability to reproduce' argument, which is aimed towards genuine pedophiles who exclusively want children for romantic and sexual relationships.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, genuine pedophilia doesn't automatically make you non-reproductive; as all of us who are healthy, still have lots of healthy sperm to make babies with. And, just because most of our sperm do end up either onto or inside children, it doesn't automatically mean that some of it cannot end up inside sexually mature females.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There are several genuine pedophiles to my knowledge, actually a lot of them, who are parents to several children, either through marriage or girlfriends, as we speak.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Just because we exclusively prefer children for sex, doesn't make us incapable of having sex with sexually mature partners. Neither does it make us incapable of feeling loneliness and having a wish to raise a family, like most do.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         For several genuine pedophiles who prefer young children, some adults can actually become attractive to some extent. They may have a very nice and special personality, maybe a childish and playful inner side, and even be young and beautiful, which makes us all able to actually enjoy adult sex.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Actually, you may consider pedophiles as more reproductive than average homosexuals who already are classified by the WHO as healthy and normal beings, and marched for and celebrated in various festivals and parades worldwide. Homosexuals have actually much greater difficulties with reproducing with cross gender adults, thus making them less reproductive than the pedophiles who are classified as mentally ill, and looked upon as non-reproductive deviants.
                         
                         <br />

                         Think about that for a moment!

                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most pedophiles, even some nepiophiles, are fully capable of feeling sexual attraction towards young adolescent girls who have just become sexually mature and reproductive, making us quite reproductive after all, according to nature itself.

                         On our way to debunk pedophilia as an illness and ugliness, to better help pedophiles make a decision between practicing sex with children or not, it is time to take a look at the Pygmy chimpanzees.

                         The anti-pedophiles, and conservative pedophiles especially, should really pay attention now!

                         The Pygmy chimpanzees belong to a species of apes that are considered to be our closest relatives in terms of genetics and sexual behavior, sharing about 99% of our DNA <u>and</u> all of our unique sexual activities that was unique for humans only. They are thus considered as being the apes who today lives closest as to how our ancestors lived in the far past.

                         Sex plays a major role in the Pygmy chimpanzee's societies, just as sex plays a major role in <u>our</u> societies. They are the most sexually active and versatile beings on the planet, just as we humans are. They are also the only other creature on the planet to share our face to face genital sex, along with oral sex and French kissing; most importantly, the only other creature on the planet to share our <u>pedophilic</u> sexuality.

                         Without being suppressed by social norms and laws, as we humans are, they are living their lives to the fullest possible extent sexually wise: they have sex all the time, without any borders nor limitations. They have regular sexual partners, just like we do, as in adult male-female sex. But they also have adult male-male and adult female-female sex, in addition to group sex and <u>adult-child</u> sexual relationships, even <u>incest</u>.

                         They are using sex to reproduce, like all animal species do. But, they are also using sex to show gratefulness, happiness and bond with each other. And this is what we're pretty sure that our ancestors did as well, therefore being a part of our very genes and natural behavior.

                         Actually, a friend of mine, whom I cannot refer to of obvious anonymity reasons, has studied the social and sexual behavior of the earliest humans, as in Homo Sapiens. His own findings, while also using the Pygmy chimpanzees for comparison, prove that the earlier humans <u>had</u> a similar social and sexual behavior far back in time, as these apes. He was able to prove that pedophilic behavior was one of several activities that was common in those ancient days, which are looked upon as both tabooed and illegal today.

                         If you're still wondering; sexual relationships between adults and children within the human species doesn't have to be wrong by nature, it doesn't have to be a deviance in the human nature. Even though it is controversial within the scientific community, there are proofs out there that actually suggest that it's not abnormal at all for human beings to have a wish for and practice sex with children, as it seems to be a normal part of nature, according to history.

                         Human children tend to seek sexual play and guidance with adults whom they trust, just as they seek all kinds of advices with adults whom they trust; because they want to know, and they need to know, how life works. All this is in their very nature and a common part of childhood and child psychology.

                         If a human child is treated nicely when doing sexual activities with an adult, there are no scientists in this world who can prove that the sexual act <u>itself</u> is the one that hurts and damages the child during that process. And, there are lots of evidence out there that proves that the only thing that really hurts the child in this regard, is the <u>society</u> itself and its shameful view on such relationships. The society makes the child feel bad and ashamed, because it did something that is so illegal to do, but in the same time felt so right.

                         The society hurts the children, not the pedophiles who treat them nicely with respect.

                         I'm not sure if this chapter has made this question any easier for you to answer, the question about having sex with children or not. But, it has hopefully moved you a little bit closer to what will be the right decision for you to <u>finally</u> make.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you are living a happy life, even though being a genuine pedophile, with a great and supportive family, with close and supportive friends, with a great job, having a great reputation or being an important and popular person in your local community, living in a small and cozy town; if you have one or several of these positive and important elements in your life, they may all become lost if you get caught for illegal child love practice. Thus, doing so may not seem like being worth the risk for many of you, which I understand and respect fully.

                         You may also be a conservative pedophile who, even after having read this chapter all the way through, <u>still</u> thinks that it's wrong having sex with children, and therefore chooses to not do it; which of course I also understand and respect fully.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, there are still several exciting things that you <u>can</u> do as a pedophile nevertheless, things that are both legal and morally acceptable, which this handbook can teach you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         One thing is for sure though, you won't be receiving any medals for <u>not</u> practicing sex with children. People will still hate you and still exclude you, regardless of what you choose to do with your sexual orientation. Even though they don't know what you are, you will still feel their hate for pedophiles, like an invisible energy radiating out from them.
                         
                         <br />

                         If your life is difficult as a pedophile, or even miserable and depressive, because you have so much lust for children stored up inside, it will definitely not help much to <u>keep</u> on living a lonely life without any kiddie fiddle or kiddie sex. Practicing sex with children might just be <u>your</u> break to live a more happy and fulfilling life as a pedophile.

                         <br />

                         If you are suicidal, please consider at least <u>trying</u> to have sex with a child before you make any fatal decisions. What do you have to loose if you are going to die anyway?

                         Never underestimate the powerful feeling of actually making love to a cute, fragile and innocent little child, and entering climax while having her or him tightly in your strong arms.

                         Because, sex will always be extraordinary powerful for pedophiles, contrary to any other sexual orientation. We are the ones who get the highest and hardest kicks out of sex, because pedophilia is so forbidden and exciting, almost like extreme sports, while the children are <span class="glow_magenta">awe</span>somely <u>cute</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, if you treat children nice, they will experience the same powerful excitement and kick also; being so forbidden, being their very first time, exploring adult genitalia, and feeling love and care from an adult in the same time; not to mention learning a lot of important stuff about the human sexuality.

                         By practicing child love, you will make many pedophiles proud. And, you will become an important part of actually changing the world: the more pedophiles who practice kind sex with children, the more powerful we become; and the more children will be taught that sex with adults is fun, exciting and not dangerous, neither anything to be ashamed by.
