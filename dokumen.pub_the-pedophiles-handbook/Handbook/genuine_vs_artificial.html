                         Genuine pedophiles are pedophiles who can be considered as <u>real</u> pedophiles, as they are <u>exclusively</u> interested in immature and unformed children for romantic and sexual relationships. These pedophiles will <u>not</u> feel any true attractions towards mature and formed youths and adults.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Genuine pedophiles will be able to <u>truly</u> fall in love with children, and want to make love to children to complete and fulfill their genuine love for them. They will generally feel an urge to kiss children on their mouths and be emotionally and physically close and intimate with them as much as possible.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Genuine pedophiles will also feel way more safe, comfortable and fit when communicating and socializing with children, contrary to adults. They thus <u>prefer</u> children over adults for social relationships, as well as romance.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As a result of all this, genuine pedophiles are usually very easily liked and very popular among children. They will find it very easy to communicate with children and befriend them, while quickly gaining their love and trust. These pedophiles are usually known to be very skilled when handling children, and spend a lot of time with children in general.

                         In other words, genuine pedophiles do <u>only</u> want children. They may force themselves to love and make love to adults, but children are the only ones who can give them <u>true</u> friendships, love, romance and sex.

                         Genuine pedophiles get butterflies in their stomachs when they see beautiful and attractive children.

                         Artificial pedophiles are pedophiles who really aren't pedophiles, but they still enjoy having sex with children for various reasons other than <u>true</u> love and romance.

                         However, they are still considered as pedophiles by most people in the average society, because of their sexual interest in children, and their sexual behavior towards them.

                         We humans get kicks from many different things in life. And, since sexual relationships between adults and children are as forbidden as they are worldwide, both legally and socially, some people get a nice sexual kick from having sex with kids.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such kicks can become an addiction, which will lead several of these sexual thrill seekers to even younger children, until they one day are having sex with babies and toddlers while their hearts are pounding inside their chests.

                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Another psychological phenomena among human beings is that regular stuff becomes pretty boring with time. If you do the same things over and over again, like having sex with your colorless and boring wife, it will eventually become pretty dull.

                         This actually happens a lot with males in their thirties, which leads many of them to infidelity, and eventually infidelity with much younger females; which for some leads quickly to even younger females; and before they know it, they're suddenly crossing that legal age limit for sexual consent. And, when this line is crossed, it can only go one way, and that is down.

                         Having sex with children is an extreme action in our present average society. And for some people, this extremeness is exactly what they need to get those insane kicks.

                         They are doing it because of the kicks, not because they feel any real sexual attraction towards children in the first place.

                         It's quite common for human beings to feel social insecurity, especially sexual insecurity, which can happen with both genders and all mature age groups..
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, some people are affected by severe insecurities of such, causing a lack of both friends and lovers, which finally starts tearing on their mental health because of loneliness.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The reasons behind such insecurities can be many, and can go all the way from mental illnesses to micro penises. But there don't have to be any reasons at all, as you may just be a generally insecure person with a bottom level self-esteem, and you have always been like that.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Regardless of reason, having a bottom level self-esteem will make it quite hard to establish close friendships with adults, especially romantic and sexual relationships.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>Children</u> are some wonderful creatures. They are extremely easy to socialize with, they generally don't require any specific properties nor performances from you, and the last thing they care about is your penis size. They will also be the physically and mentally weakest among you, with the least experience, giving <u>you</u> the upper hand with lots of control, especially among young children. And this is a true boost for anyone's confidence and self-esteem.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Children will therefore become the obvious choice for people who want to experience close friendships, but is suffering from severe insecurities. And, close friendships with children can quickly lead to intimate help, play and cuddle. And, any intimacy with children can quickly lead to sexual activities through curiosity and play; all of which while feeling secure and comfortable, which cannot be achieved with most adults.

                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Children solve such problems easily, which can become a <u>way</u> for a person with a bottom level self-esteem to raise and feel good about himself; as most want friends and lovers.

                         When an adult partner is not available, especially for a very long while, most people will become increasingly horny with an increasingly longing and desire for sex; but not just sex, also for general physical intimacy with another human being.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This regards both adult males and females, but males are usually the ones who get the strongest desires, the quickest.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Prisons are proofs of this: regardless of being a male or a female prison, many heterosexual inmates turn to each other for volunteer gay sex as a substitute for a lacking ideal partner of the opposite gender. This also happens in other gender monotone environments, like the military.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, even though you're not a genuine pedophile, a beautiful and cute child <u>will</u> become a nice substitute for an ideal adult parter if you get horny enough and just got to have some sex. Not to mention having some nice hair to smell into, sweet lips to kiss, while feeling a warm and nude body close to yours.

                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This happens a lot within close family relationships, as in incest, especially when a horny father haven't been intimate with his adult partner for a long while. Or, when old grandpa doesn't get his sexual needs satisfied by his old wife.
                         
                         <br />

                         When little Jane or Joe then comes close to them, with nice smelling blond hair and a large and pointy red mouth, that kid will suddenly become a very tempting substitute for seduction and sex, and a perfect little sex toy to play with.

                         Now we get to the last, but also to the least pleasant reason for artificial pedophilia. It doesn't have to be all that bad of course, but in most of these cases, it doesn't become a pleasurable experience for the children.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         While some get a kick out of doing something illegal or pushing norms, other people get a kick out of dominating another human being sexually. This is also known as sadomasochism, or S/M in short, and is a sexual fetish among a minority of people.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Since adults are hard to dominate fully, and pretending to be so will never be the real thing, children are usually perfect for this thing. They can very easily be dominated; and when being dominated hard enough, they will usually start to cry and express fear, giving the dominator an even greater kick.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can also expand into hard rape and hurtcore, as some people get sexually aroused by hearing someone cry or scream during sexual activities.
                         
                         <br />

                         And once again, these people aren't genuine pedophiles. They are only having sex with children because it gives them a sexual kick and general pleasure from dominating them.

                         Artificial pedophiles are usually not having sex with kids due to genuine romantic love for children, but rather due to other reasons completely, like some special fetishes or substitutes.

                         &#160;

                         But, some of these pedophiles get caught for their actions, which makes them immediately branded as real pedophiles by the law enforcement and court systems, and by everyone else whom are witnessing such cases.

                         This is what makes the pedophilia sexual orientation so misunderstood, because of this incorrect branding.
                         
                         <br />

                         Actually, some of these artificial pedophiles think that they are real pedophiles themselves.

                         This is an important part of learning what pedophilia really is, because now you see that there's an important separation between <b class="h">pedophilia</b> and <b class="h">actions</b>; having sex with children doesn't automatically mean that you are a pedophile.

                         Artificial pedophiles are also the people who usually give genuine pedophiles a bad reputation, as their actions towards children are very often based on exploitation of different sorts, as in pure sexual satisfaction only, and sometimes hurtful domination, <u>rather</u> than true love.

                         Well, it is important for me now to note and emphasize that I'm <u>not</u> looking down on artificial pedophiles. I'm just saying things as they are, and are trying to help you understand the difference between genuine and artificial pedophilia.

                         Artificial pedophiles aren't any less worthy than genuine pedophiles in my opinion; we're all here for the exact same reason, which is a sexual interest for children. It's just that our interests for children come from different origins; that's all.

                         If you think that you fit within the description of genuine pedophiles, you are most likely a pedophile.

                         If you feel that you fit more within the descriptions of artificial pedophiles, you are most likely a non-pedophile who just allow yourself to enjoy having sex with children.
