                         I just want to use these last minutes to thank everyone of you who have taken this special journey along with me through all the guides, chapters and sections of this strange handbook.

                         I sincerely hope that it has done something positive for you and your life as a genuine nepiophile, pedophile or hebephile. I hope it has given you a better understanding about your orientation, and helped you dealing with it in a better way than before. I hope you've now learned more about children and how they work, than you did before. I hope, even though how scary it may have been, that you've learned how to stay more secure and be better prepared for anything negative that may come from the practice of pedophilia. And I hope I've given you wisdom and motivation to get up in the morning and try finding yourself a child through various exciting ways. Finally, I hope that you will one day be able to make love to a child and have a fully qualified sexual intercourse with the sweetie of your dreams, for the very first time in your life.

                         If you ever feel like taking this special journey once again, you're free to start all over again at the first page, and we'll go through it and witness its strange landscape once more; or as many times as you want to, because the handbook will always be here for you, as long as the Tor network is operative

                         I generally recommend reading this handbook at least twice, and use the relevant chapters <u>as</u> you proceed in life as a pedophile or child lover.
