                         This last chapter will be the last part of your security policy as a practicing pedophile, which is all about protecting yourself and your children spouses from the Child Post-Trauma effect.

                         I work a lot with both children and adults whom claim to be victims of what they interpret as sexual abuse. This is very interesting and informative work, as I can get a pretty good peek into their worlds to learn and realize why so many people end up with post-traumatic stress based on childhood sexual experiences and relationships with adults.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Well, sexual abuse <u>does</u> exist. Children can be abused in many different ways, thus they can end up with post-traumatic stress disorder for several good reasons.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The problem however, is that our current society isn't able to make that important <u>separation</u> between actual sexual abuse and non sexual abuse. Thus, all sexual relationships between children and adults are consequently labeled and stamped as 'child abuse' in our modern society, regardless.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This does something to our society, but most importantly it does something to our children:

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         There are pedophiles out there who actually get caught for their illegal child love practice <u>long</u> after they practiced it. What they thought was all over and in the past, as positive memories for both themselves and their little lovers, suddenly becomes a nightmare when one of those children later in life decides to tell about it and report it to the law enforcement.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         So, why does this happen and how do we prevent it?

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This is obviously an important and potential security problem for all practicing pedophiles, which sends us to a pretty complicated subject about our society and its sexual culture, and how all this influences the children within it:

                         <br />

                         Most people who haven't been sleeping under a rock all their lives, know pretty well what the general society thinks about sexual relationships between adults and children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In most parts of the world, pedophilia is considered as one of the worst crimes a human being can possibly commit; sometimes even worse than <u>killing</u> children in cold blood.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Like, when a pedophile gets out of prison in some countries, he will be exposed in public as a pedophile by becoming registered in public sexual offenders lists and having a marker on his home, all of which is required by local laws. But, when a child murderer gets out of prison, he doesn't have to do this at all, thus live as completely unexposed and safe.

                         Some governments, and the residents within them, seem to prefer or not care having a child murderer living in a family community; while they sure hell want <u>everyone</u> to know that an average kiddie fiddler has moved in there.
                         
                         <br />

                         You don't have to be a particularly smart or educated person to easily see that something isn't right here.

                         This can actually be explained by looking backwards in time, and looking at the history of human social cultures:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Only a few centuries ago, people where actually lit on fire for having other believes and interests than the majority of certain societies, especially related to religion. It's important to note that these unusual believes and interests where initially harmless, but the majority back then did obviously not think so. They though it was very harmful, thus why they tied innocent human beings to poles and lit them on fire, while some where even alive when the fire was lit. And such events had a large group of spectators, children included. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, <u>alternate</u> ideas and interests back in the ancient human culture where quickly met with ropes, dry wood and matches.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some of these innocent victims where scientists and alternate thinkers who stated publicly that the universe was quite different from the writings and claims of the holy bible, thus they became sentenced to death as heretics.

                         However, most of these innocent victims where people believed to be witches and wizards capable of casting spells, and daemons capable of obsessing, simply because they acted and looked differently from the rest.

                         Even children, who unfortunately where born with either physical or psychological anomalies, where thrown on bonfires as well, usually after having been drown first, to burn the evil spirits that where believed to exist within them.

                         This behavior is just totally insane, right? I mean, they <u>must</u> have had different brains than ours! Or, maybe they used some sort of a drug that altered their behavior in such ways?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, no. The ancient and modern human brains are physically <u>identical</u>. And there where no drugs back then that could cause this wide spread behavior among humans.
                         
                         <br />

                         So, what the heck is going on here?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There's a weakness in the human brain, or a flaw if you like, which has always been a part of our species, and still is today. This weakness can explain a lot of crazy stuff related to both past and present time, in various societies and cultures.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And this weakness is the <u>fear</u> towards the alternate and <u>fear</u> towards the unknown. This weakness makes people fear things that they really don't have to fear at all, while not fearing things that they really should have feared completely.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most of the people who where sentenced as heretics and imaginary creatures back in ancient times, where actually harmless and nice people. While the ones who really where evil and dangerous, like the leaders and followers of the churches who pursued and killed innocent people like this, where looked upon as the harmless and nice ones.
                         
                         <br />

                         And this human weakness is still here today:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Like already stated, pedophiles who have enjoyed consensus sex with children, are less popular and more feared than e.g. cold blooded child murderers, and murderers in general.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I once heard a famous person say to a large audience, that he had more respect for Osama Bin Ladan and Saddam Hussein, added together, than the average pedophile in our society, followed by an ear deafening applause.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                  
                         And this is 2014, among computers and quantum physics; which means that however much we have been able to invent and develop, the majority of the human species is still that ancient species that lived more than 500 years ago:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                                           
                         The majority of humans do still try to force minorities to adapt to the majority; and if a minority fails to adapt, it will be suppressed and terminated from the society.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This makes the pedophiles of today the modern versions of the ancient philosophers, witches and daemons. Because, we are a minority with unique believes and interests that the majority fear for no valid reasons.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This makes the governments of today the modern versions of the old churches; being full of greed, corruption and an unlimited urge to control and brainwash its residents.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This makes the court systems of today the modern versions of the ancient human bonfires.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Another important problem with this weakness is its heritage:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Back in the ancient times, children grew up with the fear of heretics, witches and daemons. They where programmed like a computer to respond to those threats just like their parents and grandparents did. And, the same thing is happening today: children are growing up with a fear of being touched in any wrong way by any adult during their childhood, because they are either directly or indirectly taught that this will harm them and destroy them as living beings.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                         
                         
                         This is why naturally sexually curious children, who experience positive and pedagogic sexual relationship with adults whom they like and trust, end up as mentally ill and can no longer function normally in the society.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This human weakness infects our society, and makes it sick. Our society is ill, and it needs help!

                         As I initially wrote in this chapter, I work a lot with both children and adults whom come to me for help to handle what they interpret as childhood sexual abuse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But most of them actually remember those childhood sexual experiences with adults as something initially positive, remembering it as consensual, exciting and pleasurable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And this is actually what makes them confused in the first place; having positive experiences from sexual relationships with adults as children, but in the same time living in a society and culture that both despise and criminalize such.

                                   One earlier patient of mine was a young female who came to me and wanted to tell about her childhood.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   She actually had a very happy childhood, except for <u>one</u> thing that she was struggling to deal with and understand.

                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />

                                   At the age of about 5 years old, she began to visit a close male relative and his wife. She quickly became very close to this male relative of hers, and ended up liking him very much. They both ended up liking each other very much.

                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />

                                   He had one day started to feel her upper thighs underneath her dresses and skirts, which she told me that she <u>initially</u> liked and thought was exciting. He had then asked her if he was allowed to touch her more, which she agreed to. And that led her to her very first orgasm, as her special adult friend began touching and fiddling with her genitals.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   And that first orgasm was the beginning of an exciting sexual adventure for those two, according to the rest of the stories she told me.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   For instance, she told me that she got sexually aroused by giving him oral sex, and generally enjoyed being masturbated to orgasms by touching and licking.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   She also loved the secrecy and excitement of it all, and was always looking forward to visit him to play and enjoy their secret sexual games.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   And all this from the age of just 5 years old.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />

                                   Her main concern of today, which is quite usual for similar patients, was that she actually <u>liked</u> what happened back then, even though she knew today that it was all wrong.

                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />

                                   Then I came to the point when it was suitable to ask her:
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   At <u>which</u> point in her life, and under <u>which</u> circumstance, did she suddenly look at that relationship as something wrong? What was the experience that created this <u>change</u> inside her?
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   And this part is crucial!
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />

                                   She first began to look at it as wrong when she came in her latter childhood (about 11 years old) and after having had her first <u>real</u> sexual education class at school. She then learned how wrong it is for adults to perform sexual activities with children, and that it was illegal by law and had to be reported to the police. She also learned how important it was to get professional help after having experienced something like that.

                                   Further sexual education classes throughout her teens, along with the general society, thought her the same thing, and reminded her that she <u>had</u> been raped, she <u>was</u> a victim of child sexual abuse, and she <u>had</u> to report it to the police.

                                   <br />

                                   <br />

                                   She finally ended up feeling dirty and ashamed, and eventually began hating that close male relative of hers whom she once loved so much and had sex with as a child.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This patient is a textbook sample: a child who <u>enjoys</u> sexual activities with adults as a child, but is gradually brainwashed by the society to dislike and repulse it during its latter childhood.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   To help my patient, I had to make her realize what it was that <u>actually</u> broke that happiness that once where in her life.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   And the thing that broke that happiness was the <u>society</u>, not anything that happened during her childhood. It was the sexual education classes and her general environment that <u>actually</u> broke her happiness and made her mentally ill.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   As soon as she realized that, she also realized that she never really where any victim of any sexual abuse as a child.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                                                      
                                   Her sexual experiences with an adult during her childhood was exciting and fun, and taught her so much about her own sexuality and sex in general. It also taught her how to interact sexually with males, which helped her a lot when she began to have sex with other boys later in life.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   She became a victim of the <u>society</u> and its punishment towards everyone who don't fit within the majority, <u>not</u> a victim of her childhood sexual experiences with an adult.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   <br />

                                   She eventually became fully recovered, got her happy life back, while no one became reported. And this is <u>one</u> of many positive stories of helping people with similar issues.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This makes my job special, and that makes me fortunate!

                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Other people have gone through even worse confusions and mental illnesses from similar experiences, which has caused them to either tell about it to family or friends, or report it directly to the law enforcement.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And many of these unfortunate people are actually children, being confused by the society and not knowing what to do, feeling all alone in the dark.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some are even pressured by family or friends to report it to the law enforcement, after having told about it, even though they don't want to. Because, no one stops for just one moment to review what <u>actually</u> happened, and if it's <u>really</u> worth reporting as a crime or not.
                         
                         <br />

                         Thus, too many people end up reporting harmless stuff to the law enforcement, with fatal consequences for all parties involved, just because of an ill and dysfunctional society.

                         We are talking about police interrogations and public shame, and sending kind and loving people to prison, to have their lives messed up completely, just for having loved children in an <u>alternate</u> and totally <u>harmless</u> way.

                         We are talking about children and adults who are forced to go through regular therapy for something that doesn't need any regular therapy in the first place, causing mental illnesses to be <u>created</u>, which really weren't there to begin with.

                         And <u>all</u> this pain and destruction, <u>just</u> because of an illness in our society that no one dares to touch.

                         This is why I help my patients in the way I do, as explained in my latter sample with that former patient of mine.

                         Of course, this sort of therapy is highly controversial within human psychology. It is not what you have been taught during your psychology education. And some patients are having a hard time accepting it. But it <u>does</u> help a lot of patients, and ends most of their problems once and for all.

                         <br />

                         Actually, my <u>children</u> patients are those who are best at handling this controversial treatment:

                         <div class="misc">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                                             
                                   Like this 8 year old girl who was referred to me from her school, because they couldn't figure out what caused her increasing crazy and violent behavior.

                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />

                                   She eventually told me, in her own way, that she had regular sexual intercourses with her dad. Yes, he came all the way inside her vagina, and they had been doing that for as long as she could remember.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   I then asked her what she <u>really</u> thought about what she and her daddy where doing together, and all those special games they played.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   This made her look at me in a strange way; because I was obviously the first person in her life who didn't <u>brand</u> her as a victim, but instead gave her the <u>integrity</u> to tell what she actually felt towards her sexual relationship with her daddy.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   She finally told me that she actually liked what they did together, and that she loved her dad so much and didn't want him to go to prison.

                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Her last statement was an important clue, which finally led me to the root of her problem and crazy behavior: the <u>fear</u> of getting caught and seeing her beloved dad go to prison.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   This fear became too much for that young child to handle mentally, so it was transferred into crazy and violent behavior, which is pretty common for children to do in general.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   What they did together was something she really wanted to. She loved coming home from school and do her homework with her dad, and then play the 'ride the horsey' game with him afterwards in her bed, as in making love together.

                                   <br />

                                   I was finally able to convince her that she had no reasons to fear getting caught, as long as she didn't tell about it. No one would ever know about it, nor see through her, if she just kept their secret. And that secret keeping is very easy.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   I also gave her the same post-trauma prevention pedagogy as I will teach you later in this chapter.

                                   And of course, I additionally thought her to set some boundaries for her dad to respect, in case he would become too eager.

                                   The school later reported back to me that I had done wonders with her, as she had suddenly become such a calm and straight pupil again, after just a few sessions at my office.

                         And these two stories from my real life, are just two of <u>many</u> happy stories with positive endings; with both adults and children <u>realizing</u> that consensual and happy sex between adults and children, are <u>truly</u> not dangerous <u>nor</u> any harmful.

                         And this is the essence of this chapter, as we will now go straight for the post-trauma prevention pedagogy, so <u>you</u> can do the same thing with <u>your</u> little kiddie lovers, to secure the happiness, security and whole future of the both of you:

                         <b>Post-Trauma Prevention</b>
                         
                         <br />

                         Sex is a natural part of human life, and one of our strongest and deepest instincts and desires. And when two humans share a positive sexual experience together, wonderful things happen between them while special bonds are created.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most importantly, there are no scientifically proven laws in nature that prohibits sexual relationships between children and adults; in the same time as all healthy children are sexually curious and active, and naturally attracted to adults whom they trust for sexual play and education.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Sex between adults and children is beautiful and important, and this is something all kids need to learn as early as possible. They also need to learn to think for themselves, and become independent minds, not let the majority of the society, aka the culture, think for them and control them like slaves. And <u>this</u> is the cure for the illness of our society.

                         All active pedophiles who practice sex with children, or those who're about to do so, should do the same thing as I do with my patients: make sure that as many children as possible learn about how the society works and that positive practice of pedophilia is not dangerous nor harmful..

                         <br />

                         This is called <b class="h">post-trauma prevention</b>, and requires only a few and easy steps that should be repeated now and then.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You don't need to be a trained professional to do this, <u>everyone</u> can do it!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         The more children who learn about this, the quicker the society will heal and become well; while it becomes less likely that those children will report kind and loving pedophiles to the law enforcement later in their lives.

                         This procedure is recommended to be performed sometime <u>after</u> you have practiced positive sex with a child, ideally as soon as possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Please note that you <u>may</u> perform this procedure on children whom you practiced positive sex with a long time ago, as it is <u>never</u> too late to perform it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This pedagogy works on <u>all</u> children at <u>all</u> ages, whether being 4 year olds, 15 year olds, or anyone in between.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, children younger than 4 years of age may have difficulties understanding this fully, while children older than 15 should not need this pedagogy at all. You're still perfectly allowed to perform this procedure on <u>any</u> child of your choice, regardless of its age and intellectual level.

                         <br />
                         
                         My favorite way of going about this, is to first tell the child a fairytale about 'the witch Ella'.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Children love fairytales, and their senses and learning abilities are at their very sharpest when listening to them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Of course, you are free to use whatever name you like for the witch; maybe a name more suitable for <u>your</u> region and culture? You may also tell this story in your own way, though it's important to stick to the fundamental story line.

                         This fairytale can be told in almost any environment; but I highly recommend telling it in a very cozy environment, like when being close to each other in a bed during bedtime.

                         Okay, the story goes like this:

                                   "A very long time ago, there was a girl named Ella. She was a young girl who lived in a large village in the woods."

                                   "Ella was different from all the other people in her village; she <u>looked</u> different and <u>acted</u> different. She had long dark and thick hair, a nose that was a little larger than usual, fingers that where a little longer than usual too, and she loved to draw and create special things that she collected in her little house. She also loved to cook, and tried to invent many different meals and recipes in her large black pot, on her large black stove."

                                   "But, no one in the village liked Ella! They didn't like her because she was <u>so</u> different from all the others, which made all the others become afraid of her."

They began to believe that she was a bad bad witch that could harm them; maybe cast spells on them and turn them all into green little frogs!"
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   "One night, all the other villagers got so afraid of Ella that they gathered together without Ella knowing about it, and decided to throw her out of the village!"

She had to do that because she was a bad bad witch!"

She had never hurt anyone, and she never wanted to do so either. She had always been kind and polite towards everyone else in the village. And she had always been so helpful."

                                   "One day, she met another girl in the woods, whom came towards her with curious eyes. That girl was <u>just</u> like her, another person who was different too, and all alone as well."

                                   "Together they became friends. And later, they found even more new friends, all of whom where different in their own unique ways, and had been kicked out of their villages as well; just for being different."

                         This fairytale is a sad story; but it ends well, because young Ella is a true little survivor and hero! The children who hear this fairytale will like and look up to Ella, which is the very <u>foundation</u> for this post-trauma prevention pedagogy.

                         Well, the whole purpose of this story is to cause an emotional impact on the child, so the child will remember it and think about it for a long time; and enjoy hearing it told even more times in the future, especially if the child is quite young.

                         Now we will move over to the modern society, and teach the child some facts about how harmless and innocent differences among people in our modern society affect us negatively, just as it did poor but brave young Ella.

                         This second step can and should be performed right after the story about Ella:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                                   "The fairytale about young Ella is actually true, as it <u>really</u> did happen one time. But that was a very long time ago when all humans weren't as smart as we are today."
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />

                                   "Today we are smarter, because we have lived longer than anyone in the past, thus we have learned a lot of new things. For instance, we know today that witches really don't exist."

                                   "But even today, many people are still afraid of other people who are different. Many people who are different today, just like Ella where different in the old days, get teased and bullied, and are often left alone without any friends. Just like Ella was. Not because there's something really wrong with these different people, like there was nothing really wrong with Ella either, but because there are so many people in our world that are afraid of people who just are <u>different</u> from the rest."
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   "This happens because there are still so many stupid people in our world today who don't understand that being different is <u>nothing</u> to be afraid of."

                                   "And it is <u>so</u> important, when we are different, that we don't become sad because we are different. Being different is <u>not</u> like being bad. Doing different things is <u>not</u> like doing bad things. And being different does <u>not</u> mean that there's something wrong with us. We can be as different as we want to, as <u>long</u> as we don't hurt anyone.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Just like Ella and her <u>new</u> friends in the woods, we should be proud of being different from the rest of the world, and be strong and stick together, and support each other, while we do all those special things that are so exciting and fun to do."

                         Most children will be able to couple the Ella fairytale with this modern perspective, and really understand that being different isn't bad nor anything to be ashamed about.

                         The final part of this post-trauma prevention pedagogy is to talk about the special relationship that you presently have, or once had, with your little spouse and lover.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         We will now create important <u>links</u> between the unfairness that Ella experienced in ancient times, which so many people still experience today, with positive sexual relationships between adults and children.

                         This should ideally be told right after the latter two talks:

                                   "You know, just like Ella, and so many other different people in our world, <u>we</u> are also different, you and me. We are different because we play special games and do special things together; things that <u>have</u> to be a secret, because many people in our world don't like what we are doing."

                                   "<u>We</u> are like Ella and her new friends. And all the other people who don't like what we are doing together, are like those <u>other</u> villagers who didn't like Ella."

But still, there are so many people in our world, stupid people, who don't like what we're doing, and who are afraid of what we're doing. If they find out about us, they will be angry at us and harm us, just like the villagers harmed poor Ella. And that's why we keep it a secret."

                                   "And maybe, one time in the future, people will become even smarter than they are today, and realize that the special things we do together, and all our special games, are nothing to be afraid of nor anything to fear and dislike after all. And if that time ever come, such things don't have to be secrets anymore. But for now, it has to be a secret, but a secret that we should be proud of having."

                         It's important for you to regularly read through this chapter and remind yourself about all the shortcomings of the human species and its culture. This is important to suppress your feeling of guilt, and to get inspired to repeat child post-trauma prevention pedagogy with your little spouse(s).

                         I am happy to tell you that you have now successfully gone through the darkest and most horrifying part of the handbook, and is now outside and in the sun again, hearing twittering birds and children laughter all around you. And, you are still alive and free to continue into the most exciting and special parts of the handbook, which is to find yourself children and make love to them in the most correct, gentle and delicious ways possible. But, doing so while being educated about the most important subject of pedophilia practice: <b class="h">security</b>.

                         Thank you for reading through this guide! I'll be seeing you again soon when you enter the next one. We will then try finding yourself a child to befriend and/or seduce sexually.
