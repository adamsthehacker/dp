                         Welcome to <b>The Pedophile's Handbook</b>!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It is my very pleasure to introduce a handbook for pedophiles in Tor land. It currently consists of 5 individual guides, including 2 sub-guides, 28 chapters, and approximately 271000 words; which is a considerably large project that has taken some time to complete, equaling a book of 576 A4 pages using a font size of 12 pixels.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;                         
                         <br />
                         
                         This is a complete and continuously growing handbook that covers the most important subjects regarding pedophilia and children, being a free and open HTML handbook that can be easily, safely and immediately viewed without Java, Cookies or memberships. There's also a <a href="download/index.html" target="_blank">download edition</a> available.

                         This handbook is inspired by The Mule's child love guide in both appearance and writings, and should be considered as its successor and next generation 'child love guide'. This handbook is totally new, so no content from its predecessor has been added.

                         It has also been designed with newbie pedophiles in mind, and young males especially. But it should <u>also</u> offer a lot of important information to the more experienced as well.

                         A modern web browser that supports <span style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px green">CSS3</span> is recommended, like the latest Firefox web browser, or any equally powerful. Without a modern and decent web browser, this handbook may not appear nor work as intended. It has been developed and tested successfully on Firefox.

                         Unfortunately, this handbook is probably not that tablet nor smartphone friendly, as it has been designed on and for regular computers especially.

                         By the way, if you think the scrollbar on the right looks bad, I can't do much about that, because it is based on your operating system's theme settings. It may also be based on your browser's settings. You may change its appearance by looking into your own appearance settings locally.

                         This handbook is really a collection of several different guides that covers several different subjects related to pedophilia. Each guide has its own list of chapters, which can be navigated within by hovering your mouse over the <b class="h">Chapters</b> link at the top menu. And, each chapter has several paragraphs and sections, which you may also navigate within with help from the <b class="h">Page Navigation</b> link.

                         Feel free to test these two links now, if you like. They only contain sample chapters and sections, because this introduction doesn't have any chapters or anchored sections.

                         If you want to bookmark a special place in the handbook, simply bookmark one of the links in the <b class="h">Page Navigation</b> list, and you can return to that part at any later time. You may also bookmark a whole <b class="h">Chapter</b> in the same way, if you like.

                         Did you notice that <b class="h">Important</b> box? This is a special box that I will use many times during the handbook to highlight anything that is important for you to note.
                         
                         <br />

                         Let's take a look at some more boxes that you'll encounter:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                                   This Security box is the most important box of them all, as it will highlight crucial security notes during the whole handbook.
                              
                                   <br />

                                   If you overlook <u>these</u> boxes, you may put yourself in jeopardy.

                                   This is a general box that will highlight various stuff from the mainstream writing. That top header will of course change to a relevant header for the subject within.

                         And, there are just three more boxes, all of which illustrate speech:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                                   "Hi there, little one. It's <u>so</u> cold outside, may I therefore warm my hands some into your panties?"
                                   
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This light blue speech box illustrates adult speech, and will be used many times during the handbook to give you exsamples of what to say to a child in certain situations.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_child">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                              
                                   "Ew! Go away your mean and yucky man!"
                                   
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         Well, that pink box is obviously illustrating children speech!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                                   "I heard that! Freeze motherfucker! You're under arrest!"
                                   
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         That last and red speech box illustrates an adversary, which will be used as speech samples when being confronted by cops and various third-parties.

                         Great! You should now know how to navigate this handbook, and know all about its basic elements. You will anyway learn quickly how things work as you start reading it.

                         This handbook is generally very easy to use, and the text has been written in a special way so that non-English users should much easier understand what I'm writing. Though, this sort of writing may seem odd to some native English users, but all of you should be able to understand it and be able to read it efficiently with a great flow. It is also important for me to camouflage my own native language, whether being native English or not, to protect my own location and identity.
