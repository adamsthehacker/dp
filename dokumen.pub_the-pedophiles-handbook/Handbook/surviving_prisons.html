                         You're now in the very deepest, darkest, coldest and most horrifying part of the whole handbook. It's almost like you wish you never went into this hole at all. Your candle is barely visible, and you're stepping over bones and sculls. Something is moving all sound you, but you cannot see it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         If you manage to go all the way through this chapter, you will eventually find a door, and that door will lead to the stairs that goes up towards the light again, to the sun and the warmth.
                         
                         <br />

                         So, let's keep on moving, carefully and silently.

                         Serving prison time is the very last joint of the chain of death.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, you can comfort yourself with the fact that <u>this</u> is the very last stop, so it can't get any worse. This is the very bottom with only one way to go, which is up and into freedom again, to finally get out and put everything behind you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Thus, surviving your prison sentence is crucial.

                         Being a pedophile inmate inside a prison is obviously something that no normal being wishes for, as you may have seen all the cliches in various movies and TV shows about pedophiles being heavily unpopular and vulnerable inside.
                         
                         <br />

                         There are other cliches too that regard all new inmates, like bullying, robbery, violence, rape and becoming a bitch.

                         Unfortunately, there is some truth to all this. And this truth is based on the fact that prisons are generally less pleasant places with less pleasant people occupying them.

                         But, there's only <u>some</u> truth to all this, so let's start off by looking into some prison facts, and see if we can debunk some of the most common cliches and myths out there:

                         The first thing to sort out before continuing, is the difference between jails and prisons.

                         This varies a lot from country to country, but they usually have these functions in common:

                         A jail serves as a temporary lockup for people who have been recently arrested and are awaiting trial. Some are also used for inmates with shorter sentences.

                         A prison serves as a longterm lockup for people who have been charged in court for longer sentences.

                         Jails are usually quite crowded and unstable lockups, which may become dangerous some places, all depending on the size of the jail. Some can become pretty large, while others are pretty small, like jails at small and local police stations.

                         A hierarchy is a power structure inside prisons that divides individuals into different levels of initial respect. It is based on the crimes you have committed and is being 
                         sentenced for.

                         This hierarchy exists in almost all prisons worldwide.

                         Here's a sample of an average prison hierarchy system:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <ol>
                    
                                   <li class="space">Bank robbers</li>
                                   
                                   <div>If you enter a prison as a bank robber or a jewelry thief, you will initially start at the top of the hierarchy, especially if you are high-profile. Of course, this won't be any guarantee from being bullied around, but you <u>will</u> have an initial high respect. You will quickly make new friends, which is very important inside prisons, whom want to hear about your exiting stories.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Gang members</li>
                                   
                                   <div>A gang member who enters prison will go from his gang outside to his gang inside. He will rarely have anything to worry about, and will be initially protected by his gang members who welcome him and protect him.</div>

                                   <li class="space">Murderers</li>
                                   
                                   <div>Murderers who enter prison will initially have lots of respect, as they are obviously capable of murder, thus you wouldn't want to mess with them and get them as enemies. But still, they do only find themselves towards the mid part of the hierarchy, thus they are to some extent bullied around if they don't show any strength.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Average thieves (and small fishes)</li>
                                   
                                   <div>These guys enter prisons as less dangerous people, and most of them are young prison novices. These prisoners will become very vulnerable and easily exploited if they're not big nor handle fighting well. Though, they are the primary group for gang recruitment, as the gangs look for new members to make them bigger and stronger.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Rapists</li>
                                   
                                   <div>Now, we are moving towards the bottom of the prison hierarchy. Rapists who enter a prison are those who none of the above prefer to have as friends nor be seen around with. Neither do most gangs want to have anything to do with them, except for a few exceptions. They have sexually violated women, thus quickly becoming lonely and a weak minority inside the prison. This can quickly lead to bullying and explorations.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Pedophiles</li>
                                   
                                   <div>Pedophiles are treated similarly to rapists, but <u>we</u> are in an even worse situation, as we have sexually violated sweet small and innocent little children, at least this is how the other prisoners will see it. We consist of an even smaller minority, and will become even more potentially victimized. Not only will the inmates hate us, but the guards as well. So, it is challenging for us to be inside.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Cops</li>
                                   
                                   <div>If you're a cop, and you end up in a prison, you will suddenly have a big problem. Being a pedophile suddenly becomes warm, nice and safe in compare. These guys will be harassed and bullied beyond imagination. They are lucky if they even survive the first half of their sentence. And the same goes for covnicted prison guards.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Informants</li>
                                   
                                   <div>If you tell on your fellow inmates, you're done. Period. And this is the very bottom of the prison hierarchy.</div>
                         
                              </ol>

                         One of the first things that probably comes to your mind when you think about prisons, are violence and rape. And this is probably something you've learned through movies and TV shows about prisons, or just general rumors here and there.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Before 1990, violence and rape in prisons where quite usual. And the further back in time you go, the worse it gets.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Prisons back then where like small versions of hell, with few to no prisoner rights and lots of corruption in the administration. It was even quite usual for prison guards back then to victimize the inmates.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         After 1990 however, something changed within the whole prison system in most parts of the developed world. And this change was the introduction of gang members taking their gangs <u>into</u> the prisons, which introduced a whole new set of challenges for the prison administrations. The main challenge was to actually keep the gangs from taking over the prison system all together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, there where already street gangs before that era, but the whole street gang thing changed into a way more violent sort and grew out of proportions during the 90's.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The whole prison system simply <u>had</u> to change into a way more controlled, surveyed and generally strict system. And this led automatically to more prisoner rights being put in place and monitored, as well as much less corruption within the administrations. So, the average prison as of 2014 is very different from the average prison as of e.g. 1994 and earlier.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Today, gang activities are one of the biggest problems in most countries of the developed world, and it is <u>the</u> biggest problem for most prisons and their administrations.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Not only are gang activities a headache for the prison administration, but overcrowded prisons too. There are generally more inmates being sent to prisons today, than there are prisons available to house them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, the average prison as of 2014 is a very controlled, surveyed and generally strict, simply to keep things in control. And such systems make it very hard for inmates to practice violence and rape against fellow inmates on a large scale.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as a fight breaks out, the guards are extremely quick to break it up and stop it, as any fight can very quickly lead to a complete riot in overcrowded prisons. Most fights last thus for just 15-30 seconds before being broken up and stopped by the guards. Outside in the yard, there's usually an alarm that goes off as soon as a fight begins, which means: lay down or get shot by the tower guards.

                         Killings in prisons are rare these days. The total number of deaths per year in average prisons in the developed world is initially low. And about 75% of these deaths are actually due to either suicides, illnesses, drug overdoses or legitimate accidents. And most of the deaths being caused by cold blooded murders, are gang related. Thus, the odds of being killed in an average prison by cold blood is extremely low; about 1 to 10,000,000 or so, according to official studies.

                         When we come to prison rapes, that is actually quite rare as well these days. Even those inmates who actually <u>want</u> to have sex with each other, struggle to make that happen without being seen by guards and surveillance cameras.

                         Of course, violence, killings and rapes <u>do</u> exist. You may get beaten up. You may get killed. You may end up being raped. But all this is quite rare in average and modern prisons in the developed world of today.

                         However, bitches are more common. And by bitches, I mean prisoners who become someone's bitch by offering various sexual services for protection and group memberships. This is usually voluntarily; but many newcomers feel that they <u>have</u> to do it because they are weak, alone and feel insecure. Some inmates also do it if they feel that they are common targets of violence and rape, which unfortunately regards most inmates on the lower part of the prison hierarchy.

                         But. since violence and rape are as rare as they are today, many novices become bitches when there's no need for it. And this is very important to be aware about.

                         Routines is the machinery of prisons. You wake up in the morning to an alarm, and from there you go through static routines, which all are the same, 24/7 throughout the year, until the lights go off at night; continuously repeating itself.

                         One of those few positive thing about prisons, especially modern prisons in the developed world, is that you don't have to worry about bills and food. Your stay is free and you will be fed during the whole sentence. And you can read as many books as you like and rest as much as you want to.

                         My point is that you really don't have to think much inside a prison. Once you have gone through the initial adaption, and is no longer a freshman, things will suddenly turn into flatness and boredom. Quickly you will turn into a robot that does the same things, every single day. And this may degrade your mentality if you allow it to consume you.

                         Lack of privacy and comfort are also among those mental challenges inside prisons. There are surveillance cameras all over the place. Toilets are in the open, either in a shared cell or outside in the yard. The showers are neither much private. The beds are hard and thus difficult sleeping well on, while there are loud noises all day and unfortunately all night long. And the food is usually of low quality, being as cheap as possible to make. Privacy and comfort really don't exist at all.

                         Prisons where never meant to be nice places in the first place. They have been designed in a way so they are very cheap to run and not the places you'd like to return to anytime soon. Just imagine what would happen to the society if the prisons where like 3-5 stars hotels.

                         Before you freak out by reading this chapter, there is fortunately a dim light towards the end of this dark basement:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Prisons <u>do</u> vary a lot from country to country, and even between different areas within a country. Like, there's a huge difference between an overcrowded and corrupt Mexican prison, and a small prison at the flat planes of Iceland.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The worst kinds of prisons can quickly become your death sentence. Like, if ending up in an overcrowded and unsupervised cell with 10 crazy, angry and horny men being 2-3 times older than you; being a generally overcrowded and lawless prison that the inmates control fully, with no prisoner rights what so ever and neither any free food nor any free privileges.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The best kinds of prisons can quickly become a nice hotel stay for pedophiles, with a single cell, your own toilet and shower, a wide screen TV, and even a personal computer, while being nicely protected by the prison authorities.

                         <br />

                         There's a prison in Canada that only houses child predators. Some other traditional prisons also have their own housing units for pedophile felons. And such prisons can make your stay pretty comfortable, by generally having a nice time while hanging out with fellow pedophiles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It's important to know that not all prisons are all that bad, and many can be highly doable and survivable. It all depends on where you currently are on the planet.

                         So, if you find yourself in a country or area with super-harsh prisons, you may want to consider moving your illegal child love practice to another country or area, if possible.

                         Not only do prisons vary a lot between countries and regions regarding safety and comfort, but the legal systems vary too.

                         Your sentence will basically be related to what you have been doing. The higher level of child love practice you perform, the longer your sentence will become if caught and sentenced.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But sentences vary a lot between countries and regions:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In the US, with a legal system that is a crossbreed between Nazism and the Wild West, most prison sentences are very long and relatively harsh, with few prisoner rights. But their legal system is also very unstable; as in some states you may be sentenced for like 5 years for a certain pedophile crime, while the same crime can give you a lifetime sentence in the neighbor state.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Just take a look at the state of California for instance, with its 3-strike rule: if you get sentenced to jail for 3 relatively small crimes during your life, they will lock you up for good, with a minimum of 25 years before being able to apply for a parole.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The UK is a notch better in terms of lengths of pedophile sentences and legal system stability, but the prison conditions and prisoner rights aren't any better; if not worse.

                         If we move to South-America, Asia and Russia, especially Africa, you will end up in medieval prisons.

                         Though, and as an unique contrast to their extremely harsh and primitive prisons, these governments aren't practicing that strict laws against pedophilia in the first place. You can get away with a lot of pedophilia practice in these countries. But if you <u>do</u> get caught for it, you <u>will</u> end up all screwed.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In these regions, especially south America and Africa, the civilians tend to solve such problem themselves, by chopping off your cock or burning you alive; depending on their mood.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Western European countries, along with the arctic countries like Iceland and Greenland, are the countries that tend to practice very light prison sentences in general, while having very stable and conservative legal systems. They also tend to have the least harsh and most comfortable prisons.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This also regards Canada, actually.

                         <br />

                         You will also find countries in Europe with a lower than average age of consent, which can vary between 13-15 years of age, thus being quite liberal in addition.
                         
                         <br />

                         When finally moving to the Arab countries, in the Middle-East, something very strange suddenly happens:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In their religion and culture, girls and women are first of all not on the same level as the men. They have few to none rights and can be stoned to death if they just fart at the wrong time and place. In these countries, even children girls have been stoned to death in public streets, supported by the law.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their important religious prophet Muhammad married a 6 year old girl, and the marriage got consummated at the age of 9, which sets the baseline for their culture and legal system.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, among some, actually don't have an age of consent at all. They do however require marriage before sex, but child marriages are actually common in these countries.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Thus the practice of pedophilia is kind of legal down there.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         I really love and respect their religion and culture. But I only wish they didn't stone little girls though!

                         As you now may see, a prison is like a whole new world, or a whole new planet if you like. It requires you to adopt fully to a whole new life situation during your sentence.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Fortunately, we humans are very adaptable. Situations that initially seem totally unlikely to survive, can actually become fully survivable if you give yourself enough time to adapt.

                         <br />

                         Your prison stay in general will depend mostly on yourself and your personality, and your social skills:

                         <br />
                         
                         If you enter a prison psychologically equipped and informed, and treat other inmates with decency and respect, things may become much better contrary to the opposite; and much easier and doable than most think.

                         The check-in procedure usually starts with a strip search right after having arrived at the main prison facility where you'll be serving your sentence.

                         You will have to undress nude, move your buttocks apart, open your moth, and such, while they thoroughly inspect you. They rarely touch you during this search unless they suspect you're smuggling any drugs inside any openings. This search is usually done by a guard of your own gender.

                         You may have to do this along with other newcomers, in the same room. But it will be just like changing at a public gym.

                         At the end of the strip search, you will get your prison jumpsuit to take on, which is usually single colored with the name of the prison on it.

                         <br />
                         
                         The next station is where they register you into the system.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will be photographed and assigned a new ID number that you should try to remember, because the staff will most likely refer to you as that number from then on.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Then you come to the interview part, which is a short and initial interview alone with a chief staff member. He or she will review your papers and ask you a few questions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This part is important, as you may be asked if you have any special needs. Regardless if they ask or not, you may want to politely ask to be assigned to a protective care unit that is isolated from the general population units, because you have been sentenced for a crime that makes you a target of violence and murder attempts.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some prisons do allow this for child molesters, either by default or by request from the prisoner, while others don't. Some may at least offer you a single cell, which is better than nothing and should be accepted with gratitude.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The advantage of isolation is that you will be fully safe from bullying and violence, as you will not be interacting with other prisoners during your sentence. A lot of potential problems will suddenly be solved at once, and you can thus serve your sentence from then on in piece and calm.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The disadvantage is that you will most probably stay alone in an isolation cell most of the day, with little-to-nothing to do. Usually you're left alone for 23 hours a day, with just one hour or so for a protected shower and (outdoors) exercising.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you are a loner and fully prepared for this, especially if you are very concerned about meeting other prisoners as a sentenced pedophile, this might be the blessing you need to securely complete the sentence.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you prefer to be social and meet people, especially if you are dependent on social activities to stay happy, this can quickly become a nightmare of loneliness. It may even make you mentally ill after a certain while.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Personally, I recommend that you at least <u>try</u> isolation out a few weeks or months if possible, just to see how that works. You may avoid things that are much worse than loneliness, like everyday bullying, jerking, pushing and general violence, even sexual victimizations. And during that time, make a final decision about what you really want and need to complete your sentence as safely and convenient as possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The second and last important thing to do during this part, is to make sure that you inform the prison authorities as early as possible, while being alone with them of course, that you regret your actions and are highly motivated to get help. And that you want to go back to the society as a healed person.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Enlist and enter every possible sexual offender program they can offer, and be fully committed to these, as this will motivate them to give you more privileges and protection.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Such engagements are also good for your parole applications, when or if that time comes in the future.
                         
                         <br />

                         <span class="sub1">Medical Examination</span>
                    
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The medical examination may happen either before, during or right after the registration and interview process.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This will be just a common health examination with a few questions from a doctor. The doctor may combine a physical and mental checkup, or you'll be examined separately by a doctor and and psychologist during the examination.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you haven't yet gotten the opportunity to ask for isolation from the general public, or it was rejected, now is a good time to try making that happen, if you really want it.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         One way to get some kind of extra protection, is to convince the doctor that you are depressed and suicidal. The last things most prisons want to deal with, are suicides. So they usually take this seriously.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may just tell the doctor that you are depressed and suicidal. Optionally, and more efficient, tell the doctor that you don't need any examination, because you won't be around that long anyway, as you're fully committed to end your life. You may also ask the doctor, in a very serous way, if he or she accepts money for a drug overdose that will help you die.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The protection you might get from this, might not last forever, but it sure is a great start and basis to build further upon.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, it may also backfire: you may end up being forced to take medications and <u>still</u> end up in a general population unit. You may also end up at the psychiatric unit, which may become pretty unpleasant. So be very careful about playing mentally ill or unstable..

                         The last part of the check-in procedure is to collect some personal props, among those you had along with you, to take with you to your new quarters. Of course, they will sort through what's allowed to bring into the prison and not.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         You may get some additional props that all newcomers get, like a toothbrush, tooth paste and some toilet paper. You will usually only get the latter once. To get more of it, it has to be bought in the prison or delivered by your family or friends.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This process will consist of lots of waiting and name/ID calls.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Make sure that you are always polite and respectful towards the prison staff, and react quickly and effective when your name/ID is called.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's utterly important that the prison staff immediately experience you as a kind and safe person, as all prison staff are also potential victims of unpredictable violence and killings. If they feel secure around you, and you treat them nice, you may get advantages and privileges that you will be grateful for later during your stay. They may even become better motivated to protect you from the other prisoners if you're forced to serve your sentence in a general public unit.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />                    

                         Of course, don't hang out with the guards too much while the other prisoners see it, as that will make you look like an informer. And you don't want to get that reputation inside, especially not during your very first days.
                         
                         <br />

                         It's hard to tell for sure when or how you will be informed about the prison and how it works. Some prisons inform the newcomers in a standing position during the arrival, while others during the check-in procedure in a classroom.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         When this happens, make sure you have your ears sharpened. Listen to all info carefully and learn all the rules,

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you are handed brochures, threw them away before you enter the main prison area. The last thing you want to to, is to be seen with such brochures among the other prisoners.

                         There is no single guide about how to go through the first initiation process, and stay safe and alive on a longterm basis, because there are too many different prisons worldwide with too different ways of functioning.

                         Some are very light and safe, while others are very harsh and dangerous. Some offer pedophile inmates extra security, while others don't. Some have single cells, while others have double or even larger cells. And so forth.

                         The first weeks and initiation process is the hardest part of the whole stay, but fortunately also the shortest.

                         It all begins with the frightening experience of entering a general population unit while carrying your bedsheets and personal belongings towards your new cell, and having to pass by other inmates while being verbally and sometimes physically harassed. This harassment may also be sexually oriented, like whistling and stuff.

                         The first mistake most newbies now do, is to believe that it will <u>always</u> be like this, every single day, during the whole stay.

                         But it won't!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is just how the prison culture works, as in just being an initial and common ritual of 'welcoming' new prisoners.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They <u>just</u> want to scare the hell out of you and push you down mentally as much as possible, as early as possible, so they can take advantage of you later when feeling weak.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They will now do an initial search for weaknesses, with their naked eyes, and target the weakest looking ones of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, now you have a very unique opportunity to make yourself a less likely victim by doing something very easy that doesn't require any large efforts at all:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just smile some while walking towards your assigned cell with your head and shoulders raised, while <u>not</u> looking at any other prisoners <u>nor</u> into their eyes. Look like: been there, done that, stupid morons.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With such an entrance, regardless of being harassed or not, they will more likely go for the other new guy who don't act like this, the one who looks down and have fear and tininess written all over him. And they will more likely believe that you've been in a prison before and know how things work.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can be the most important act in your life, which can actually set the baseline for the rest of your stay and how other prisoners will interact with you from then on. It may also shorten this whole initiation process.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The less you allow yourself to be affected by it, and the less attention you give them, the less fun it will be for them to bully you, and the less likely they will try exploiting you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you arrive a prison cell with an inmate inside it, continue acting confident and act like you know your way around. Immediately, and without any hesitations, get yourself comfortable by throwing your stuff onto the available bunk, while respecting your cell mate's space and belongings.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Give him a short and friendly greet, but nothing more, unless he wants to have conversations with you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Your new cell mate will probably be just as curious about you as you will be about him.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just keep in mind that they yet don't know whom you are and what you've done. To them at this point, you are <u>just</u> a new prisoner, and that is all the information they got.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, the way you now act in front of other prisoners, will be like feeding them with information about you:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you act confident, as already mentioned, they will think that you are a confident and strong person; thus they will initially treat you like one. If you act otherwise, they will obviously treat you otherwise instead.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And <u>this</u> is something important that <u>you</u> control at this stage.

                         If you have to, or choose to, serve your sentence in a general population unit, you might end up in situations when inmates bully you, which is pretty common for pedophile inmates.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Someone may call you names, tug you around some, stand in your way, or even try stealing from you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This usually happens because you are dealing with less mature and less intelligent inmates who are testing you out to see if you can be exploited in any way. And most prisons have a few of those, unfortunately.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Name calling and light tugging should just be ignored while not showing <u>any</u> emotional response at all towards it; just pretend that it didn't happen and keep on doing what you where currently doing. You will then show <u>strength</u> and <u>maturity</u> towards both the bullies and any spectator, which will give you lots of initial respect.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, don't try to be tough and hit the first person who calls you names or tugs you some; as this will actually give you less respect, while paradoxically showing that you're weak and vulnerable, and fun to mess with later as free entertainment. And of course, the one you just struck will most likely strike back with ten times the force, and you won't know when.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If anyone stands in your way, like in a staircase, and does that on purpose, even though you've politely asked the inmate(s) to move some so you can pass, try finding an alternate route. If there are no alternate routes, or they've surrounded you, ask politely what this is all about. And if talking sense to them doesn't work, just start walking and try walking through them, like if you where walking through thick bushes in the jungle. Tell them that this is just nonsense and a waste of both their own and your time. Don't panic, don't show them any fear, don't start hitting them, just struggle your way through, while having a stone face that shows no feelings at all. Eventually they will give up, or a guard will come along and break it up.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If someone steals from you, like stealing dessert from your food tray or any stuff from your cell, while you're around to see it, simply get it back. At least <u>try</u> getting it back, even if that means wrestling some with the thief, and even if it means destroying the object in the process. Just like the latter samples, keep your head cool while doing it, and don't go bananas and try beating the person up. Just focus on the <u>object</u> that has been stolen, and try consistently to take it back. Do this every single time it happens, even if you eventually loose the fight or get beaten up. Just show the thief and all spectators that you stand up for yourself and your belongings. They will eventually give up, because they will learn that stealing from you isn't worth all that struggle, and they can't entertain themselves by making you upset.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Any attack against you that has no basis, should be responded with the exact same counterattack. If anyone spits at you, spit back instantly. Or do it the next day. If anyone hits you, hit them back, even though they're larger than yourself. Optionally, hit them back later when they're not ready for it, even though you end up beaten up. Do this every time, and show all the nearby inmates that attacking you will only result in a counterattack, even though they're larger than yourself and beat you up. You stand up for yourself and pay back with the exact same amount as they gave you; which also is fair.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         I know this may sound scary, but it's usually just temporarily and something that you <u>may</u> have to go through for a couple of weeks, until they learn who you are.
                         
                         <br />

                         Such responses will give you a lot of respect, while making it less likely for you to end up as a victim of bulling, or worse.

                         A difficult decision that most new pedophile inmates face, when being placed in a general population unit, is what to tell the other inmates about themselves if asked.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, most inmates practice a code of not asking about each other's sentences and crimes, so this should initially not become an issue. But you may still end up being asked about it in one way or another, at some point during your sentence, making this issue important to think through.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There are 4 ways to go about this, with different effects:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="dont_tell_anything"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">Don't Tell Anything</span>
                    
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The first option is to keep quiet about your sentence, forever.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                    
                         
                         So if anyone should ask, even if it's a good friend of yours, just say that your crimes are no one's business except for yourself, and say that in a direct but polite way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But being secretive about your sentence will usually make it hard to find and keep good friends and allied, which is important inside prisons. And by not telling about it to an inmate that regards you as a friend, can lead to speculations about you being afraid of doing so, which can mean that you have something shameful to hide, like being charged for child molestation. This can further lead to gossips and rumors.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />                    
                         
                         And, prisons are one of those places where it's hard to keep secrets regardless. Thus, you may end up in a constant worry about the truth about you being leaked somehow, at some point in the future. Like, some inmates may ask friends over the phone to search your name on the Internet, or corrupt guards can be paid to reveal it.

                         This will make you initially much safer among other prisoners, and it will become much easier to find new friends and allied, who will quickly accept you and trust you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It will generally be very convenient, as you may create any story you like about yourself and why you ended up in prison.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This option will be very similar to the latter, but it will cause even greater damage if your true sentence should be revealed. It is bad enough being a pedophile inmate, but it's even worse being a <u>lying</u> pedophile inmate.
                         
                         <br />

                         Any decent friendship or status that you might have built for yourself, will fall apart into a total wreck. And you will draw a fair amount of negative attention towards yourself, which will stick to you for years to come, while ending up very lonely.

                         <br />
                         
                         You may tell the partial truth, like you have been caught for having consensual sex with an underage, but lie about the child's age, like saying that the girl was 14 instead of e.g. 6.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This won't mark you as a real pedophile, but neither will it give you much respect.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And like the latter two options, you will still have that fear of the real story about you being revealed. However, since the lie is only partial, it will cause less damage if revealed.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It may even cause some confusions; was the girl 14 or was she 6? Who's telling the truth here?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, you may just stick to saying that the girl was underage, but keep the age to yourself.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This will definitely make you an instant target of bullying and exclusion, especially if having fiddled with very young kids.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But now at least, you won't have to fear that anything will be revealed at any later point in the future. You will also gain some kind of respect for being unafraid about telling the whole truth and being <u>totally</u> honest among other inmates.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some pedophiles have actually been left mostly alone after that, in pure respect from being such honest.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Not to mention, it will now be easier for other sentenced pedophiles to find <u>you</u> and ally with you; which actually is one of those very few positive things about prisons.

                         If the truth about your sentence ever gets revealed, either by yourself or through a leakage, it is utterly important that you <u>never</u> brag about your actions. <u>Neither</u> try convincing other inmates how nice it is to fuck children, and that pedophilia isn't all that bad after all. This will only provoke the wrong persons even more than they already are, which will further reduce your personal security. Instead, give them the impression that you are regretful about your actions, and that you will seek help as soon as possible and never repeat your actions ever again when you get out. This may calm things down a bit, and make things a little bit easier for yourself.

                         <br />

                         I'm not going to tell you what will be best for you to do, this must be <u>your</u> decision if you ever end up in this situation.

                         <br />

                         Personally, I would probably have started with a combination of the first and third option. I would have kept my sentence for myself until I met someone I felt I could trust. And only then told that I'm in for having been in a sexual relationship with an underage, but that it was consensual and a positive experience for her. And from there on, taken things <u>very</u> gradually and carefully.

                         There are several inmates who aren't pedophiles themselves, but neither look at it as something that awfully and unforgiving. And such friends would be important to find and keep.

                         <u>Always</u> keep your head looking forward and walk tall while moving around during your whole sentence, as this will make you seem confident and unafraid. If you look down and walk small while moving around, you will seem scared and weak.

                         <u>Never</u> show any emotions. Never show other inmates that you're sad or depressed, as this shows a weakness. Neither show them, nor the guards, what makes you happy and sad; because that can be used against you later to manipulate or threaten you, by taking away the things that make you happy and giving you things that make you sad.

A large and nice inmate may approach you and offer you protection, friends, even extra food and treats, if you blow him off or let him screw you a couple of times a day, which most people will eventually find easy doing and worth all the earnings. But, this will most likely be just temporary, and you might even be traded away to another person who treats you horribly. Becoming a bitch should only be a <u>last</u> resort to save your own life, if you're <u>completely</u> sure that this is the only way to survive and someday get out.

                         This must have been some frighting reading for most of you, even made you think twice about practicing illegal pedophilia.

                         But that is actually a good thing!

                         The pedophiles who aren't worried, are the pedophiles who tend to be careless and sloppy, and the pedophiles who tend to actually end up in a prison.

                         The pedophiles who are afraid of getting caught and fear prisons, are the pedophiles who are <u>very</u> careful and thoughtful about what they're doing, thus will be able to do a lot of illegal things with children without getting caught and without ending up in a prison.

                         Thus, I don't intend to scare you from practicing child love, only scare you <u>towards</u> taking security seriously.

                         But no one is bulletproof; so if you should end up in a prison, you will now know how the process goes and how to succeed and survive the stay, while making the stay itself as secure, short and comfortable as possible.
