                         My second recommendation for finding children is to gain yourself access to schools, as in working at schools either as a teacher, substitute, volunteer or janitor.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         My primary recommendation is elementary schools, which this chapter is based on. But we'll also look into preschools, after-schools and junior high schools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The basis for this recommendation is that this method has the most interesting advantages out of all other methods, as long as you can live with some significant disadvantages.
                         
                         <br />

                         I will now go through all the advantages and disadvantages, which will give you a good idea about what this is all about:

                         School teachers need high education, but they are usually left under-payed and over-worked in the end. So, it's not one of the most attractive careers and professions out there.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Neither is it a profession for everyone, as most teachers become teachers for <u>unique</u> reasons.

                         And the human population is continuously growing, and won't get any smaller anytime soon. Thus, new schools are contentiously being built while the old ones are expanded.
                         
                         <br />

                         This leaves us with not as many fully educated teachers out there as it ideally should have been; meaning that several schools do actually have either less or even non-educated teachers in some of their classes, just to have <u>someone</u> standing there in front of the kids and tutoring them.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         So, the hard fact is that there's an increasing need for new and <u>fully</u> educated and qualified school teachers in the developed world, with lots of headhunting going on to recruit new teachers, even when they're still at the academy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         There's <u>also</u> a great need for substitute teachers out there, as most child institutions are more affected by sickness and other leaves of absence among the employees than usual; which usually don't require any high education, giving you a much easier and quicker way into the schools as a pedophile.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It is also possible to work as a volunteer assistant for <u>free</u>, either during your teacher degree education to gain experience, or as a part of exploring the teacher profession. Most child institutions look at free workers as a <u>blessing</u>, as long as you can deliver a good reason to work there for free, which of course I will help you do in this chapter.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A school janitor job is probably the easiest way for a pedophile to get inside a school and access children, especially at small and easily maintainable schools that rarely require any engineering education.

                         The point being: it is generally easy to access schools as pedophiles, and much easier than most think.

                         The first thing you notice when you pass by a school, is that there are <u>lots</u> of children gathered inside a <u>small</u> area with a fence around it; almost like a miniature Heaven for pedophiles, even though there are a few small devils in there.

                         Being an employee at a school means that you will have the <u>passport</u> to freely and safely exist and move around inside this fence. You will be able to freely contact children, talk to them, play and have fun, establish contacts, and generally hang out with many different children at once.

                         What was that saying again; lots of fishes in a small pond?

                         With so many different children accessible within such a limited space, with so many different ages and personalities, there's like a 99.99% chance of finding yourself a perfect child and match within a reasonable time frame.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         And as if all this wasn't enough, a natural part of being a teacher is to speak with children alone. Teachers do this all the time, either to follow up the children individually or have confidential talks with certain pupils for different reasons.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         All this will obviously open up great opportunities for social engineering, friendships, fiddling, or even pure molests if there's time and space to do such.

                         As a trusted school employee, you will be granted access to personal information about the kids, like home addresses, grades, weaknesses and personal problems, illnesses, and basically their whole school history.

                         Even if access to this information shouldn't be available to you, like if you're only a substitute or volunteer teacher, we're not talking about Pentagon here, so there should be ways to access this info in one way or another. Paradoxically, the janitor is probably the only employee, next to the headmaster, with the best access to this info. He should be able to move silently all over the school building, along with lots of hardware tools and 100 keys, without attracting suspicions.

                         Let's say you find little Ella's file, which informs you that she's a 9 year old troubled girl, having a mom with alcohol and drug problems, no dad in sight, monitored by the child protection service, have low grades and is known to act out towards other children. And, wow, there she stands, a beautiful girl with long dark hair and pale skin, all by herself in the school yard, with her small fingers through the wired fence, looking towards the outside, wishing that she wasn't there. And from behind, in blur, a male approaches her, and that male is <u>you</u>.

                         Elementary schools do usually consist of 6 to 12 year olds, depending on your country and region.

                         This is a really great span, as it fits the majority of pedophiles, all the way from delicious and snooty little brats to more mature and adolescent children, all gathered in <u>one</u> basket.

                         There are <u>many</u> pedophile males and female teachers to be found within elementary and junior high schools as we speak. <u>They</u> are usually the only ones who love children high enough to go through a teacher education process, and afterwards stand all the challenges that a regular teacher meets; and still go to work every single day with a burning passion for children and their small and beautiful hearts.

                         While it isn't <u>especially</u> hard getting a teaching degree for an elementary school, it still requires some work and dedication to gain it; especially if you're already fully employed elsewhere, so you'll have to do evening schools to gain it, and use a lot of your spare time for quite a long period.

                         Being a fully qualified teacher means that you will get a lot of <u>responsibilities</u> towards your classes and their children, especially related to their performance and social behavior. There are certain expectations that will have to be met, by both your superiors and most parents.

                         As a teacher, at any class level, you're bound to handle a few difficult children. And this will require lots of energy and motivation to keep you going.

                         Just <u>one</u> single 6 year old is capable of bringing a large male down, both mentally and physically. They can become seriously headstrong and consistent, and they have lots of energy to fight you at various levels, each and every day.

                         And the older these children get, the harder it becomes to handle and control them, especially those with the most  severe behavior problems.

                         I've worked with many different schools during my life, and studied even more. There isn't a <u>single</u> school out there that doesn't have at least 3 troubled children that are true menaces to the whole school, and to the whole world in general, all the way from 5 years of age.

                         However, the worst sort of children out there <u>are</u> the easiest ones to seduce and practice sex with. <u>And</u> they're usually not believed when they tell on pedophiles. This is <u>especially</u> important to notice.

                         Most substitute teachers are there to just fill a temporary void, so they won't become as integrated and involved in the schools as regular teachers do. This can mean some restricted access to the children and their confidential info.
                         
                         <br />

                         Substitute teachers will also have limited time to find a mate, as their positions are usually very temporary.

                         You will need to have a basic level of authority within, to successfully be able to gain the kids respect and keep the classroom under control. If you're a naturally shy and compliant person, you can quickly end up as their <u>meal</u>.

                         Many pedophiles discard this method at once, simply because they initially look at the teacher profession with fear.

                         Yes, it sure has its challenges, but it also has its rewards. Unfortunately, the rewards are too often <u>overlooked</u>, which I hope I've made you realize now.

                         Actually, the most important thing with being a teacher, is that you will be able to use your mentor status to guide children sexually, so they can learn to <u>love</u> shameless sex with adults, instead of fearing it and becoming traumatized from it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         And the great thing about this, is that you can actually do this with lots of children <u>without</u> having sex with them, as in just teaching them with words to embrace pedophilia as something wonderful and educative; which sometimes causes some of them to actually seduce you sexually.

                         <br />
                         
                         This can be accomplished by e.g. creating a secret society with some of the kids, the more the better, and meet up together in secrecy to talk about and optionally try out forbidden things. This is actually being practiced, to my knowledge and as we speak, by a few brave teachers.
                         
                         <br />

                         And if you <u>do</u> choose to have sex with them, you will additionally prove to them in <u>practice</u> how fun, harmless and educative pedophilia really is.
                         
                         <br />

                         So, your decision to become a teacher will actually become an important resource for all current and future children and pedophiles out there, along with the whole human culture. Becoming a school teacher, especially at elementary schools, is really an effective way to change the children; and change the whole world to become a much better and safer place for both children and pedophiles to live within and enjoy.

                         As a pedophile, who loves children with absolute dedication and motivation, you're already <u>qualified</u>. You only need the formal education on paper to enter this highly important and rewarding role, and begin saving our kids and our future.

                         If you have no experience what so ever from any official child care or child education work, my personal recommendation is to start at the very bottom as a volunteer teacher.

                         You will then be able to quickly get a pretty good idea about how it's like working at e.g. elementary schools, while in the same time gaining classroom experience on paper that will become important later as you climb up the latter.

                         Another nice thing about this, is that you can actually do this even if you already have a job. You just need to take some days or hours off your regular job, and use that free time to work as a volunteer teacher.

                         This is generally a very easy way to gain access to schools. And if you succeed, it will open up new opportunities while making it contentiously easier to access other schools and child institutions in the future.

                         Almost all elementary schools, and child institutions in general, are aware of pedophiles. So, most schools will initially look at any request for volunteer work as suspicious, especially if you're a male with no experience nor testimonials from any similar work from earlier in your life.

                         This may seem like an uncomfortable and embarrassing situation to put yourself within. But you <u>must</u> note and remind yourself that it is <u>not</u> illegal to request for volunteer work at elementary schools, while being a <u>very</u> positive initiative from an objective viewpoint.

                         A nice trick to make this challenge lighter, is to work with your family, friends and neighbors, whom obviously like and trust you, in advance of your requests, as in telling them about your great interest for teaching work and general pedagogy. And the longer you do this in advance, the better it gets.

                         Having support from family and friends is beneficial, as you can actually use them as testimonials when requesting for volunteer work. If the school decides to contact any of them to better learn who you really are, they will give the schools good words about you and your interest for teaching work.

                         Having support from your neighbors and local community is also a very nice thing, especially if you're living in a small community or town. And several of them may even have kids in the schools you're aiming for.

                         The more support you have, and the more people being behind you, the less uncomfortable and embarrassing you will feel when requesting for volunteer work.

                         Actually, if you live in a very small community or town, and start spreading the word about your interest for teaching work around, it may eventually end up at the schools. And if the schools find this interesting, <u>they</u> may actually contact <u>you</u>, which will make things very ideal and convenient for you.

                         All this isn't strictly required to succeed becoming a volunteer teacher though, it's is just an optional foundation to stand on when contacting schools, to make things more convenient.

                         And please note that even how much suspicious a school may initially become, most do still look at this as something very positive, and a great inspiration among most already school teachers who will happily become your mentors.

                         And luckily, we are living in an era now that is less suspicious towards this in general, contrary to e.g. 10-15 years ago.

                         I always recommend contacting <u>local</u> elementary schools, and start with the closest one to your home.

                         It will seem natural that you want to work at nearby schools, and seem kind of suspicious if you prefer schools located far away from your local community.

                         When you've found a school to contact, it's almost always best to contact them by email with your request.

                         Emailing is the modern and effective way of communicating, which allows you to create a high quality advertisement of yourself that you can calmly create and design to turn you into a very appealing and interesting person. The receiver will also be able to calmly review your request and take her or his time to make up an option about it and what to do with it.

                         By calling them by phone, they may not be prepared for it, and thus become confused and unsure, in the same time as trying to be polite, turning it into a potentially uncomfortable and embarrassing conversation, and a pretty bad start.

                         If the school doesn't have any email addresses, just write and send them a regular paper letter instead.

                                   Then write about your interest for the teaching profession, which you've had for a long time but not been able to explore. Thus, you would now like to explore this profession and see how it's like, before making any important decisions in life.

                                   It is usually a great idea to additionally write that you care a lot for all children, and look at any work and interactions with children as something very personally rewarding and interesting, because it feels right being there for the children as a resource and protector, and form them into well educated and self-confident beings.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Finally add a picture of yourself, as this is a <u>very</u> positive factor, along with your referrals if you got any.

                         If you've not been working with children before, they can't expect any relevant referrals. But <u>any</u> referral will help a lot and make them trust you more easier, even though if it's just your own mom or sister. It <u>is</u> however recommended to use <u>female</u> referrals when referring to family and friends, as females tend to appear as more comforting and trustworthy.

                         You may also ask your current employees or bosses to be your testimonials, as long as you're comfortable with informing your current workplace about the possibility of leaving them to become a teacher.
                         
                         <br />

                         Most elementary schools are underfunded and overworked, and in an always need of an extra pair of hands. By offering to work for them for <u>free</u>, with a good and plausible excuse, most people should be highly welcome. Thus, you will most likely hear from them, sooner or later.

                         Substitute teachers are temporary teachers who are there to fill temporary voids in the school system when regular teachers are sick, pregnant, on holidays, on courses, and etc.

                         Becoming a substitute teacher is usually the natural next step from volunteer work, optionally towards a fully qualified teacher. Or, it can become a place to land on indefinitely if you're able to make a living of irregular and sporadic work.

                         Compared to volunteer workers, substitute teachers usually have more responsibilities, so a basic level of teaching experience and skills is usually required.

                         <br />
                         
                         In most regions worldwide, substitute teacher jobs don't require the same level of education as regular teacher jobs.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, it never hurts to complete at least <u>some</u> sort of education; the subs with the best education, will be the subs who get the most and best paid jobs.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You should at least have a high school diploma, or equivalent, which most people have. If you don't have it already, Internet or evening schools will easily solve that problem.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Ideally, you should have some basic degrees within some of the most common subjects within elementary school, at least a general child care work degree. This won't be all that hard nor that time consuming to acquire, which can also be done through Internet or evening schools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also want to acquire a basic degree within child gymnastics, as such substitute work will make you able to touch children more and see them with less clothes on.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The more experience and time you gain within substitute teaching, the better fitted and more attractive you'll become, and the more work and better assignments will await you, along with an increasing trust and access to more schools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Many schools do actually assign uneducated teachers to jobs that should have had fully qualified teachers, especially at elementary schools. There just aren't enough fully qualified teachers out there to fill the increasing need for it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, if you work hard and long as a substitute teacher, and acquire some relevant academic degrees, you may actually end up getting a full teacher job even without a complete teacher degree.

                         The first thing you should do before contacting any schools for substitute teaching jobs, is to look out for relevant employment ads in local newspapers and on local websites, especially at the schools own websites.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The best way to go about this, is to contact the department of education in your local community, city or province, either through email, letter or phone, and ask them for guidance.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They will either offer you application papers that you'll need to fill out and send back, or they will tell you to contact your local schools and apply to them directly, depending on where you live in the world.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most importantly, you must also ask them about the basic educational requirements needed in their area to become a sub, so you can have this is in place when finally applying. Optionally, ask different departments in different areas, as these requirements may actually vary some.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're prompted to contact the schools directly, just send them a formal application through an email or a letter.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You will most likely have to contact private schools directly for substitute teaching work anyway, but they are also more demanding regarding your education and experience.

                                   Begin writing some about yourself, like your name and where you're from, along with your age and current life situation. It is important to appear open and honest.

                                   Then write about your interest for the teaching profession, and <u>emphasize</u> that you've been working voluntarily at elementary schools to gain classroom experience, as this will give the readers a positive impression of your engagement. You should also add that you're considering a full teacher degree, but you want to further explore this profession some before making any important decisions in life.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   It is usually a great idea to additionally write that you care a lot for all children, and look at any work and interactions with children as something very personally rewarding and interesting, because it feels right being there for the children as a resource and protector, and form them into well educated and self-confident beings.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Finally add a picture of yourself, as this is a <u>very</u> positive factor, along with your referrals.
                                                                                
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         Even though if you just get application papers from your local district that you just need to fill out and send back, still attach a formal application like this one when returning the papers, as this will be a very positive factor.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, you <u>must</u> prepare yourself for a lack of response, and sending several applications to different districts or schools; because substitute teaching work actually <u>requires</u> that regular teachers are off duty, of various reasons, which doesn't happen all that often. And with the high unemployment rates of today, you will most likely not be the only one applying for this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But the <u>way</u> you present yourself in your applications will be your <u>strength</u>; as in emphasizing volunteer work and a great love for children and for teaching them, which definitely will make you more attractive than those who just fill out a gray forms or send gray and boring applications around.

                         I once knew a person who began studying psychology at the age of 48. And somewhere before the age of 60, he finally completed his education and started his own therapy center, which he still runs today with success, and loves running.

                         Becoming a school teacher is far less demanding, so you can actually start even if you're older.

                         Old students are very respected among younger students and most teachers. Their choice to go back to school is extremely inspiring for anyone who think they're too old to do something about their careers and lives.

                         Even though if you have no education at all, simply start at the bottom, get the basic degrees, and work your way upwards.

                         Of course, this will require that you make some important changes to your life. So, before making any important decisions, make sure that this is what you <u>really</u> want to do.

                         Then there's only one thing to do, which is getting yourself the required education and licenses, to finally become a pedophile school teacher.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         First, you will need a high school diploma, or equivalent, to gain access to a university.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Most adult people have this already and don't need to take this first step. Those who don't have this already, can easily get it through Internet or evening schools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then you will need a university degree that gives you a basic qualification for elementary school teaching.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may already have an academic degree that already makes you basically qualified for elementary school teaching. Or, you may have a degree that makes you partially qualified, so you only need a few additional courses to complete.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will need about 3-4 years of full-time university study. Part-time university study is also possible in most regions, but it will add a couple of years to the whole.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Completing some <u>additional</u> relevant university degrees is highly recommended to make yourself as attractive as possible when applying for teacher positions, making it easier for you to get a job in the end. This is especially important if your country is suffering from high unemployment rates and heavy competition. Some regions may even <u>require</u> some additional degrees. These degrees are anyway just <u>add-ons</u>, thus much lighter than the main degree.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, you will need a certain amount of practical experience, also known as classroom experience, which actually is required in most world regions to become a fully qualified school teacher. This can be acquired through volunteer work, but it's usually an integrated part of your main degree that is organized by your university.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some regions require a teacher certificate to access their schools as a fully qualified teacher. The requirements for such certificates are mostly about your current education, grades and scores, classroom experience, referrals and recommendations.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Most countries of the developed world will additionally, or as a part of that teacher certificate, check if you got a fully clean police record, which is <u>required</u> to work at schools.

                         A freshly educated elementary school teacher, with great scores and lots of classroom experience, will be highly attractive among most schools.

                         If you're able to move to any part of your country, getting a job should be next to inevitable. You will most likely be offered several jobs during your search, even be headhunted and offered a job before your education is fully complete.
                         
                         <br />

                         And many schools will actually be willing to lay off a less qualified teacher to make room for you, meaning that <u>any</u> school is a potential candidate.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This procedure will actually become very easy. It will be pretty much the same as applying for any job out there, so I recommend that you either look for free guidance or pay for professional guidance regarding job searching, application writing and interviews, fitting the requirements of your region.

                         This won't be the same as applying for volunteer or substitute work. This will require a whole new level of professionalism.

                         <br />
                         
                         The only way to get inside a school as an employee <u>without</u> becoming a teacher of any kind, is to become a school janitor.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But then comes a couple of significant obstacles:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         School janitors are first of all not supposed to <u>interact</u> with the children in the same way as teachers do, they are only there to perform practical duties related to repair and maintenance. They <u>will</u> be able to communicate with the children to a certain degree, which most actually do, but usually not enough to build any real relationships. As soon as they try to communicate with the children in a way that is unusual for janitors to do, they can too easily get detected, thus quickly fall under negative suspicions, even get fired.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Another problem is that janitor work may require some kind of education after all, like an electrician or engineering degree at a university. And if you don't have this already, you may risk using a lot of time and money on education that may not give you what you want and need in the end, which are the kids.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, if we take a look at the bright side for a moment, there are schools out there with janitors who actually do got a general close relationship with the pupils, because the ethics and culture of those particular schools allow it. The pupils are sometimes allowed to go with the janitor to help him out with certain easy tasks, especially at elementary schools. And it's generally allowed for the janitor to communicate, and even play some, with the children. Such school cultures are usually to be found at the smaller schools in the smaller towns. Or, it becomes possible because a school is so big that the janitor can blend into the crowd without being easily noticed.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And of course, not all schools require an electrician or engineering degree for their janitor positions. You may get such a position even without a basic school diploma. Heck, I've actually heard about non-educated ex drug addicts and convicts who've been janitors at certain elementary schools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I generally don't recommend janitor work as a serious way for pedophiles to gain access to schools, unless you think that it can be possible finding yourself a little spouse without detection at certain schools, or you know that they don't require any higher education for employment.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Nevertheless, a janitor job <u>will</u> get you inside those fences, and it <u>will</u> give you access to confidential information about the children going there, all of which is far better than staying outside the fences.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A janitor will also be able to much easier contact the children outside school hours, as they may recognize him from school and thus trust him much easier as a new and exciting friend in the neighborhood.

                         All schools come in different sizes and locations, with their own unique pros and cons, giving them different properties that will affect pedophile teachers in different ways.

                         Thus, it's important to choose a school that will best fit your personal wants and needs, whether you're applying for volunteer work, substitute teaching, or is looking for a fully qualified teacher job.

                         Big inner city schools are the biggest and most pressured ones. We're talking about large schools with a high volume of kids and teachers running around. And some schools are so big that the teachers barely know and recognize each other.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A very important advantage with these schools is that they make it very easy for pedophile teachers to blend in and do a lot with the children, whether being inside or outside campus, without being easily noticed. There will be lots of stressed out teachers there, including yourself, and hundreds, if not thousands, of children all over the place. It's thus very hard for the school administration and guards to keep track of everything going on there. And there's a large amount of troubled children there as well, most being overseen and forgotten, who just <u>waits</u> for someone special to enter their lives and give them love and attention.

                         Though, these large schools are also the most demanding ones in general, with the largest classes, and commonly known to contain the most challenging and difficult children. Not to mention cultural and racial challenges, in addition to gang activities even at mid elementary stage. You will get your hands full, that's for sure!

                         Small town schools can be wonderful schools to work at. They're very lightweight and calm, with small classes and few children in total, who're mostly gentle and polite, coming from decent families in farming communities. Teaching at such schools can become pretty close to entering Heaven itself, making the teacher profession a dream come true.

                         Another wonderful thing about such schools and such communities, is that shame and embarrassment is very prominent, making it much harder for most children to tell about sexual relationships with their teachers, making secrecy practice quite efficient and stable.

                         A significant drawback with small schools however, is that they are much easier for the employees to supervise and control. This will make it much harder for a pedophile teacher to interact more intensively and intimately with the children without being noticed and raising suspicions.

                         Small towns make it generally harder for pedophiles to seduce children within. They seem to have some kind of a life on their own, as everyone seems to know everyone and where everyone is to be located at any given time.

                         My personal recommendation is medium sized schools, as they tend to place themselves conveniently somewhere in between the very largest and very smallest.

                         They will give you a decent room for close and regular interactions with children, without attracting too much negative attention. And they will give you not too large classes, nor too many problematic children, while having just average requirements, work loads and general stress.

                         Preschools are in many ways similar to elementary schools; as in most countries, preschools are all about preparing children below school age for first grade elementary school.

                         <br />
                         
                         There are however a few significant differences:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Preschools host a lot younger children than the elementary schools do, usually 3-5 year olds. These children will be much more protected and supervised in general, which makes it much harder to befriend and seduce them, especially hook up and hang out together after school hours.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Younger children also means that secrets can more easily be revealed through their speech, actions and general play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Preschool facilities are additionally much smaller and more intimate, thus way more supervised and controlled than any elementary school, making it much harder to do any abnormal stuff with the children <u>at</u> these facilities.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, younger children <u>do</u> equal more <u>intimacy</u>!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Contrary to regular schools, preschools will involve much more closeness through help and care, which will involve more touching and caressing, lap time and general cuddle, and even toilet aid; all of which are natural parts of preschools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         More intimate care will get you much physically and mentally closer to the children; and even closer to their genitals, which actually makes it possible to do some genital fiddling.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But then again, when being such close to children, whom you sooner or later may want to seduce sexually, while being such restricted by the strict supervision and control of regular preschool facilities, you may end up seriously frustrated.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thankfully, even how supervised and controlled a preschool can become, more intimacy <u>does</u> mean more possibilities for pedophiles. And most preschool facilities <u>do</u> have a few security holes here and there that can be exploited if you're patient and observant over a longer period of time.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some preschools host even younger children, also known as nursery schools. These schools will be even more supervised and controlled, but then again offer even more intimacy, which includes changing diapers, thus gaining <u>direct</u> access to their sweet and juicy genitals. And the youngest children won't be able to reveal any critical stuff, making it possible to practice child love at such institutions, all the way from innocent tongue kissing to fully sexual intercourses.

                         <br />
                         
                         Becoming a preschool teacher is very similar to becoming an elementary school teacher, except for having less educational requirements. I thus recommend following the same procedure, by starting with volunteer work, and from there work your way up towards a substitute or real teacher through experience and education. And of course, you should use the same recommended instructions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Not only is the preschool teacher education easier to acquire, but it is generally easier to work as such a teacher as well.

                         <br />
                         
                         It is also worth mentioning that <u>male</u> preschool volunteers, assistants and teachers are extremely popular and needed. This is because this profession is dominated by females, so the children need male role models to learn from and look up towards. The reason for this female domination, is mostly because preschool work is considered as quite feminine and less masculine work, thus keeping most normal males out. For a pedophile, this is really good news; because that means that male preschool workers are much needed, and sometimes even appreciated and prioritized over females.

                         After-school programs are activity programs for mostly elementary schoolers who either quit school before their parents quit work, or they participate in certain activity programs after school hours for special and/or educative purposes. Sometimes it is a combination of both.

                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         After-schools varies some, functionality wise, between both countries and regions, but they all have in common taking care of children a few hours after school is over.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Since the elementary school has the formal responsibility for the children's education, these programs are based less on formal education and more on play and entertainment that have educative and character building properties.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may thus look at after-schools as more of advanced babysitting services than real schools.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, since these children are usually elementary schoolers, such programs are some really great places for pedophiles to easily find themselves children within.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These programs are especially great because they really don't require much of experience nor education to join as a worker, whether being volunteer work or becoming a tutor. Several of these programs are actually very <u>dependent</u> on volunteer work in the first place, which mostly are done by some of the parents, but also by non-parents and local community members/heroes.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         So, if you're a pedophile who would like to access elementary school children, but is skeptical about becoming an elementary school teacher, after-school programs are great programs to join instead; especially because they usually run at evenings, making it easier to work there while already having a full-time job.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There aren't much of disadvantages with these programs, except for being much smaller than regular schools, thus more supervised and controlled, and with fewer children to choose from. But then again, you will have more time and better opportunities in general to bond with the children and create new and special relationships.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As already mentioned, it rarely requires any education to join after-schools. But as always, it never hurts acquiring <u>some</u> academic degrees, or at least some light courses, which are relevant for this sort of work, as that will make it <u>especially</u> easy getting into such a program <u>and</u> getting paid for it.

                         And just as with preschools, males are very popular in these programs too, as all children need male role models to learn from and look up towards. There are already lots of males both working within and running such programs already, but it still helps a lot being a male when applying for such work.

                         The same procedure as with elementary school work applies here: begin at the bottom as a volunteer, and work your way upwards. You usually go straight from a volunteer to a paid tutor after having gained enough experience and education. Just use the same recommended instructions.

                         The only huge drawback is that the educational requirements are generally much higher than any elementary school, which also regards substitute teaching. Volunteer work is more rare, unless you're looking for classroom experience as a student.

                         I know a few junior high teachers who struggled some to become fully qualified teachers, but are then again exploiting something especially important and really worth mentioning: which is making the children whore themselves for great grades. Whether being young girls or boys, some pupils sell themselves for excellent grades, through jerkoffs, blowjobs, or vaginal and anal sexual intercourses. This is actually quite common from the junior high level and upwards.

                         Actually, I didn't know that this was as common as it really is, until I got some new hebephile friends within the upper education system.

                         Before you decide becoming a junior high teacher, I highly recommend that you begin working at elementary schools, and gaining the required education and experience for that level first. Then use that teaching level as a diving board into the much heavier education that junior high schools require.

                         Whatever school you end up working at, and whatever position you start at, <u>always</u> start out carefully when you're about to befriend and seduce various children:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as you gain access to a regular school, start out by <u>not</u> interacting too much with the children, except for the obvious formal parts of your job that are expected of you.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         And when it comes to preschools and nursery schools, start out by additionally being some restricted when it comes to the intimate care of the children.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Because, as soon as you gain access to any child institution, especially as a male, eyes will be <u>all</u> on you at first!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, as soon as those eyes see that your interactions with the children are highly professional and appropriate, they will gradually look away. After a certain time, they won't be looking at you at all; and not before <u>then</u> should you start interacting with the children in a less professional and less appropriate way, <u>gradually</u>, while having eyes in the back of your neck.

                         Another important tip, and the primary purpose of actually accessing schools and similar child institutions in the first place, is not to go rampage and have sex with children at the institutions themselves; but rather use these institutions as <u>grounds</u> to befriend kids and gain their trust, and <u>then</u> aim to hook up <u>outside</u> school hours, <u>outside</u> the schools.

                         Of course, there are plenty of opportunities to have sex with children <u>at</u> these institutions, especially on the largest and most crippled elementary schools, as these schools have lots of rooms to hide within and lots of children who are sexually curious and horny; or in need of higher grades(!).

                         The referrals and testimonials you get from <u>any</u> school work will be <u>really</u> valuable papers to have if you choose to take things even further in the future, like opening your very own babysitting or scouting service, which we will go thoroughly through later in this guide.
