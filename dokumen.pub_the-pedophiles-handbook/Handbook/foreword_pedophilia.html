                         <br />
                    
                         Pedophilia is a sexual orientation within the human species that makes mature adults, both males and females, emotionally and sexually attracted to immature children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In many ways, it is a quite unique and strange orientation, especially when it becomes <u>exclusive</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is also a quite misunderstood sexual orientation among average people in the average society, while also being the most hated phenomena among the majority, making it a highly sensitive and complicated subject on several levels.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Being a pedophile can therefore become quite confusing, which can make a lot of people frightened about who they are and what they should do about their sexual orientation; especially at the point of realizing that one is exclusively attracted to young children in regards to romance and sex.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Confusion is one thing, but frustration is yet another element of disturbance in an average pedophile's life; the frustration of not being <u>fully</u> able to love someone whom you are fundamentally attracted to, on all possible levels, as a human being with strong needs and lusts that need to be fulfilled.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, I am a genuine pedophile myself, and are exclusively attracted to young children; which led me onto a path in life of education and work within general psychology, to learn about myself and my unique orientation; which again and further led me to child psychology and sexology, to learn about how children function on an emotional and sexual level.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         My education and work did finally solve that initially unsolvable puzzle that laid there in front of me, made all those tiny pieces finally fit together, which gave me a totally different perspective on myself, my role in this world, and pedophilia as a sexual orientation. It also changed my perspective on children, by learning many important and surprising things about them, some of which where quite chocking.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         What I discovered is that there's room for us after all; we <u>can</u> acquire constructive functions and roles in the society, and live satisfying lives as pedophiles, even though it is less acceptable and popular among the majority.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, <u>our</u> lives can potentially become way more exciting than the lives of the average human beings, if we allow ourselves to harness and exploit what life <u>really</u> has to offer.

                         This handbook will attempt to make all pedophile readers <u>less</u> confused and <u>less</u> concerned, and attempt to take your hands and guide you to a much better place in life where you will feel more enlightened and happy about who you are.

                         It will attempt to make your life more easier to live in the average society, teach you about the <u>true</u> nature of children and their sexuality, protect you from the law enforcement and all the pedophile haters out there, and generally help you to safely travel along this special journey that we now have in front of us, which we will make <u>together</u>, a journey into a whole new land of possibilities, excitements and pleasures.

                         If <u>you</u> are one of those confused and frustrated pedophiles, prepare yourself for a change; a change to the positive, and a change to the better.
