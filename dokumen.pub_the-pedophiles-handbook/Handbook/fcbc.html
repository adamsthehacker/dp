                         As soon as you've found a child whom seems to be a great child love candidate, it is time to start establishing a friendship between the two of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also do this in reverse, as in establishing various friendships with various children <u>first</u>, and then look for great child love candidates among your new friends.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Neither choice has any advantages over the other; this is just a matter of different preferences and situations among pedophiles.

                         Anyway, this short chapter will give you all the tools you need for establishing friendships with children at all ages.

                         Yes, this chapter is short; not because I'm tired of writing, but because friendships are so <u>easy</u> to establish: if two people really like each other, they both will feel a natural attraction that pulls them towards each other, almost like two magnets. And a new friendship will quickly be created between them, pretty much effortlessly and all by itself.

                         Making friends is a social skill that most human beings have within them from birth.

                         However, regular friendships between adults and children are somehow special, because of the age difference, and thus need some specific advices for you to successfully get lots of new little friends in no time.

                         All advices in this chapter will be based on having found children through any of the latter methods.

                         Friendships are utterly important for all intimate child love practice, whether being lightweight and legal or heavyweight and illegal, because friendships equal <b class="h">mutual affections</b>:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A friend is someone whom you want to spend time with and want to do cool things with, someone whom makes you feel safe and comfortable being around, someone whom makes you feel honest and self-confident, and someone whom feels delicate; all of which are important factors for the children to feel towards <u>you</u> when things become intimate and sexual.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Because if they do feel all this towards you, they will also feel any consensual sexual activity between the two of you as proper and natural. This will more likely give them a positive experience from such activities, which will become positive memories for the future. And positive memories in this regard will much better preserve your secrecy and the mental health of your little lovers, while they grow up within this society of ours that strongly condemn such activities and relationships.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />                         
                         
                         <u>Always</u> remember that all human beings can <u>only</u> enjoy sex, and get a positive experience from it, if they practice it with someone whom they generally like. This is almost like a physical law within human psychology; and it is important.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Not only will great friendships make sexual relationships between adults and children end successfully, great friendships will also make any sexual relationship with a child much easier to <u>initiate</u> in the first place. In other words, it will make it easier for you to actually seduce children sexually.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Friendships can also be used as pure safety beacons for pedophiles, especially for the newbies: if you <u>manage</u> to create a friendship with a child in the first place, this will more likely be a great child love candidate whom will be safe to seduce and have sex with. Those children whom you <u>don't</u> succeed befriending, are the children to steer away from.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The bottom line is this: the most successful, rewarding and safest sexual relationships between adults and children, which are the easiest ones to initiate in the first place, are those who are based on the foundations of <b class="h">great friendships</b>.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, and when all that is said, short-term sexual relationships don't require a deep friendship; like when fiddling with or molesting random children outdoors, or when buying hot and trashy kiddie prostitutes.

                         If we start with babies under the age of 1, they actually don't need to be befriended before sex.
                         
                         <br />

                         They will automatically trust and bond with <u>any</u> adult whom just picks them up and seems confident. Of course, they may cry some at first, especially if you act less confident, but they will quickly and instinctively realize that you're an alternate carer, and then settle down within your care, sooner or later.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This process will go much smoother if you act confident and assured when handling unknown babies for the first time, which usually regards nepiophiles who have just found single moms, or just began babysitting or working within daycare.

                         Babies don't have brains complex enough to interact with other humans in any advanced ways. Neither will they fully understand any child love practice, making friendships less important and relevant at the end of the day.
                         
                         <br />

                         However, as soon as the children become young toddlers, their social intelligence and skills will explode:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, all toddlers will be very different from each other when it comes to strangers. Some will immediately approach strangers and make contact, while others will look at them with fear in their faces, and then run towards the nearest carer whom they know. A few will even begin crying as soon as a stranger enters the room, and not stop anytime soon.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, toddlers can become some really complex beings to successfully befriend!

                         When it comes to toddlers, it's important that <u>you</u> don't approach <u>them</u> first, unless you really have to. Just sit down on the floor in the room where the toddler is playing, but with some distance, and just sit there and watch the toddler play.

                         It helps a lot being calm and having a nice and happy face.

                         Most toddlers will become quite curious about you, as in feeling a natural attraction to bond with new human beings. So, they usually begin approaching you very carefully, like moving their play gradually closer to you; or just toddling close by a few times to see how safe that really is.

                         If you just keep on sitting at that same location, and still looking very friendly, the average toddler will eventually begin to gradually make contact, usually by showing you toys and how they work. The more shy ones may throw you a ball instead, from a distance; you may then throw it back.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It's important that you sit still, and move slowly if you have to move, so you give the toddler the time and space it needs to befriend you in its own preferred way and pace.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as the toddler makes contact, and seems to like you, you may carefully begin moving some and try following the toddler around. When the toddler stops to pick things up or play with toys, sit down beside it. You may also talk to the toddler some while doing this, like commenting the toys it is handling or carrying, and commenting its actions.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If a toddler totally freaks out by having you in the room, which only happens with a few, just do the same thing: sit down in the room, but pay no attention to the toddler at all. Don't look at it, nor talk to it, just pretend that she or he isn't there.
                         
                         <br />

                         This will make most freaked out toddlers feel initially safer, because you're not trying to contact them, which basically is their main fear when being scared about strangers.
                         
                         <br />

                         Don't worry nor panic, they will gradually calm down and slowly approach you when <u>they</u> feel ready to do so. In the meanwhile, just pretend that they don't exist.

                         An alternate way to befriend unknown toddlers, if there are toys around, is to pick up some toys and start playing with them, instead of just sitting still and watching the toddlers. This will grab their interest even more, and make them slowly approach you to participate in your play. This will also help a lot when a toddler freaks out because of your presence.

                         I generally recommend using toys and dolls as conversation subjects and tools to befriend these gorgeous little creatures.

                         If you're a genuine nepiophile, this will be a piece of cake, because you will <u>instinctively</u> know what to do and how to love these special little dollies. And they will sense this unique love, which few other adults in their lives can offer.

                         It may sound strange, but friendships are just as important to toddlers as to any older child. You can end up having a very good toddler friend, even a toddler best friend, which is just as funny as it is cute.

                         Toddler friends will be happy to see you, as in screaming and jumping with large smiles. And they will sometimes cry when you leave them. That is pure friendship in the toddler universe, and something capable of melting even the hardest hearts.

                         Toddlers can be befriended pretty quickly. My own personal record is just 30 minutes; and I had that blond little toddler girl with curly short hair intimately in my lap, whom I squeezed, hugged, kissed and almost ate up; and she just loved that.

                         Toddlers look at the world in a strange way, like if everyone where just one big blob of the same consciousness. An average toddler thinks that everyone knows what she or he thinks and knows, and vice versa.
                         
                         <br />

                         When the children become 4 years of age, this world view changes completely. Now they begin to realize that we all aren't just <u>one</u> consciousness after all, instead we are all unique beings with unique thoughts and personalities.
                         
                         <br />

                         And this causes these children to understand friendships at a way more intellectual level, which suddenly makes friendships become very much interesting and important to them.

                         Between the ages of 4 to 6, they also lack self-discipline and self-control, while being overly enthusiastic about other human beings and life itself. They aren't that shy towards strangers anymore, in the same time as being very curious.

                         In other words, these children are definitely the easiest ones to befriend as a stranger.

                         The outgoing preschoolers will contact you almost at once, usually by asking various questions, like what's your name, where do you live, why do you have such a big nose, and etc. While the more ingoing and shy ones will keep to themselves until further, but eventually contact you <u>if</u> they like you.

                         Those who like you will keep hanging around you, continue asking and talking about many funny things, want you to play various games with them, tease you, pull your arms, stamp on your feet, hang around your legs when you try to walk, climb onto your back, hit you, and generally tear you apart slowly but surely. While those who don't like you, will just stay away from you, and have no interest at all being near you.

                         These children you may approach and contact when you like. But still don't try <u>too</u> actively nor eagerly to become their pals; approach them gently and increasingly to check how much they appreciate your friendliness. Ideally, let <u>them</u> choose when or if to approach you and become your friends instead.

                         Preschoolers are anyway easy to approach and befriend regardless, because they will never question your motives, their minds are simply too primitive for that.

                         Well, there is <u>one</u> challenge when it comes to befriending preschoolers: it can become hard being a cool guy <u>and</u> an adult in the same time. If you want to be the cool and popular guy, you must let them get away with a lot of bad and crazy stuff, which can quickly destroy a whole building if there's enough of them. If you want to be in control, and stay alive as long as possible, you must be that boring, stupid and strict adult whom they giggle behind his back and calling names.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you're dealing with 1-3 preschoolers, you can safely be that cool guy. If you're dealing with 4 or more, I strongly recommend being at least some strict, but otherwise being as cool as possible, until you finally are alone with just one or a few of them, so you can safely throw all rules into the bin.
                         
                         <br />

                         But by having already been strict, they will most likely look at you as an authoritative person regardless, which usually makes sexual seductions more difficult and critical to practice in the end. Preschoolers <u>do</u> actually prefer and <u>do</u> feel most comfortable with those cool adults whom are at <u>their</u> level, especially when exploring sexual games together.

                         Generally spoken, preschoolers who like you, will simply be all over you and eat you up. So, it's easy to notice the ones <u>who</u> really likes you, and not. And those who like you will be ridiculously easy to befriend if you're a genuine pedophile.

                         Preschoolers are capable of developing deep and intimate friendships with adults, with time, including romance among most cross gender preschoolers, which usually develop into physical closeness, whisper and secret sexual games, if they trust you enough and feel fully comfortable around you.

Some will be more physical and playful, like pulling your jacket or sweater, pushing you, and even hitting you for fun, while smiling and giggling some. Others will be more shy and careful, and gradually begin participating in any activity you're performing, without saying much at first. And all this will depend on their ages, maturities and personalities.

                         Either means that the child is interested in you as a person.

                         But this doesn't mean that the child <u>will</u> eventually become your friend, it only means that she or he is just <u>initially</u> interested and would like to check you out. If your share a decent to very good chemistry, a friendship will be inevitable, as long as you're allowed to spend time together regularly.

                         <u>You</u> may also be the one who initiates contact for the first time, if you feel brave enough to do so, or just really want to:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Doing so with the highly shy children, those who look at you and smile from a distance, is highly recommended. But do so carefully and incrementally, like first saying "hello" and establishing a short but friendly interest. Sometime later you may attempt to do a short conversation, if the child still hasn't done it all by itself, and talk some about e.g. school, interests, toys and etc. You may simply start out by asking if everything is alright, and if she or he needs any help for anything.

                         If you're going to do this with children who seems to be less interested in you, be careful and try finding a reason for doing so, especially with the older children. If they have something nice, like a cool cellphone or a nice jacket, compliment any of them and thus make yourself seen and noticed. You may use either as a conversation subject if you want to, like asking what cellphone model they got, what jacket brand they have, and etc. If you've spent some time around these children, like when being a teacher at an elementary or junior high school, and something changes, like a new jacket or hairdo, use that opportunity to do the same thing, as in complimenting them.

                         When contacting children whom seem less interested in you, try doing so when they are all alone, or among just one or two friends; not when they're in large groups of children. This will make things potentially less embarrassing for you, as children in this age group, <u>especially</u> the older girls, do have a tendency to ridicule you in one way or another when being in large groups and thus feel overly brave and arrogant; which really is more of a social group effect than individual negative personality traits.

                         Don't try too hard becoming anyone's friend. Just leave a compliment now and then, optionally with a short chat, when 'accidentally' passing by your subjects. And if they still seem uninterested after a few weeks of doing this, especially if they seem bored or annoyed by having you around, it would be a good idea to find yourself other subjects.

                         Actually, children <u>boys</u> will be generally easier to contact and befriend than children girls. They enjoy talking about boy stuff and cool toys with adult men, while being easily flattered by any adult female of course. Children girls have a tendency to become more pompous, especially the older ones, but they still get easily flattered by male attention and compliments.

                         The girls are the ones who will most likely fall in love with you, as a male, which sometimes happens at once you contact them, or even at once they see you entering a room or yard; which of course may sound a little bit too good to be true, but is just how young and confused children girl brains work.

                         When you meet children whom you don't know, greeting them nicely is always a good start that will make a good first-impression from your part, as first-impressions <u>are</u> important.

                         Be yourself. Do not try to act like someone else, as it usually fails at some point and won't feel natural nor comfortable over longer periods. You don't <u>have</u> to be someone else to make new friends, neither should you; as you <u>do</u> want people to like you for who you are, not for a character that you create.

                         A mistake many newbie pedophiles do when interacting with children, and young children especially, is to think that the more funny they are, the more they will be liked. So they think that becoming clowns (without makeup) is the best way to befriend children. But this is false. You may of course be able to make some of the kids laugh, but you will quickly loose their respect, and eventually their interest, as they will finally think that you're just a weird and phony person. Just like birthday clowns, they are funny to watch for 15-30 minutes, but after that they become boring and plain stupid, and deserves having cakes mashed into their faces and thrown into their pants; at least seen from a child's perspective.

                         It's allowed to be funny of course, but only in small portions and ideally by learning what sort of humor each child got, and play on that a few times now and then.

                         Make eye contact and smile towards children whom seem shy, but don't stare at them for more than a few seconds only. Repeat that now and then, but not too often.

                         The most important thing you can do when befriending kids, and what makes most girls between 1-15 to totally fall for you as a male, is first of all to <u>listen</u> to what they have to tell you. Stop doing whatever you're doing, face them and listen carefully. Show an interest and an engagement for their lives. Second, make them feel <u>important</u> to you and <u>special</u> in your eyes. Help them with whatever they seem to struggle with, or anything trivial for that matter. Spoil them and give them treats that is only <u>their</u> privilege. Though, be careful about the latter in groups, as other children will become jealous and other adults may suspect that you have bad intentions.

                         Ask what a child likes to do or is interested in, and use that interest to converse and approach later. Like if a 9 year old girl loves horses, study horses or take riding lessons; and the next time you meet, ask her of she has ridden any or been working with horses lately. And offer her rented riding lessons or horseback riding. If a 7 year old boy loves tractors and crawlers, that's something to talk about, with lots of pictures to look at and farming equipment stores to visit. If a 13 year old boy loves muscle cars and big engines, there are lots of things you can talk about and do together. If a 15 year old girl wants to become a model, buy yourself a digital SLR camera and say that you're interesting in photography. <u>Exploit</u> the children's interests and all the things they love and urge for.

                         Be a self-confident and trustworthy friend who <u>always</u> keeps his promises. Be humble and round, and respect that the child may have different opinions than yourself. Be honest and admit it when you've been wrong. Be kind, loving, gentle, playful and generally not too serious.

                         Most importantly: don't become pushy nor annoying if you're rejected at anytime in this process. As soon as a child rejects you, make some distance and give the child some room, before trying just once more. Children who're <u>not</u> interested in you, however much you like them, leave them be and find other ones. Because, there will <u>always</u> be children out there who likes you for whom you are. Patience will reward you!
