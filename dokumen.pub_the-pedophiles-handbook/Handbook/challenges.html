                         After having gone through the more technical part of being a genuine pedophile, we are now moving over to a more darker part of the handbook, which will from now on cover important subjects for those who are struggling with their orientations.

                         By being genuine pedophiles, most of us are bound to meet various challenges in our lives. These challenges can affect our lives in fundamental ways, because they are obstacles in living a happy and satisfying life among the majority of people.

                         Of course, this varies a lot from person to person, as all pedophiles will meet different challenges depending on our life situations and own abilities to handle challenges.

                         Some pedophiles however, meet some very huge challenges that send them right down and into a dark hole of confusion, frustration and depression. And such a dark hole may with time lead to self-despise and even suicidal thoughts.

                         This chapter will try helping you handling and overcoming the most common challenges that average genuine pedophiles meet during life, so you can more easily navigate yourself through all the obstacles that pedophilia puts in our way.

                         I've got to be honest though: there are no cures of miracle around. But there <u>are</u> ways to handle the most common challenges we meet. And, by just turning your focus towards <u>this</u>, as in trying to understand and handle your challenges instead of letting them take control over your life, can make a huge difference in regards to your wellbeing.

                         Genuine pedophiles rank high on suicidal statistics, especially nepiophiles and pedophiles who are exclusively attracted to young children, and find sexual intimacy with adults repulsive.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The reason for this is very simple: most of us are in a loose-loose situation. Whatever we do, we loose. If we don't practice sex with children and stay legal, we end up frustrated because we can never satisfy our basic human needs for romance and sex. If we do practice sex with children, we will end up in a constant fear of getting caught. And there are even more things to worry about either we don't or we do put our sexual orientation into real life practice.

                         <br />
                         
                         It's thus very understandable that a genuine pedophile may one day ask himself if this is the life that he really wants to live all the way through. And, suddenly he finds himself very close to suicidal thoughts, which is a very sad and bad thing.

                         If you're struggling mentally because of pedophilia, and this goes on over a long time, depression is almost inevitable. And, depression is one of the most self-destructive illnesses that exist in the human species; it's like a deep well that is so easy to fall into, but so difficult to get out of.

                         So how do you deal with this?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         For starters, if you're currently considering suicide because you're a pedophile, please stop doing that! And stop at once! Because if you die, so much beauty and importance will be wasted; the beauty and importance of you as a person and the beauty and importance of you as a genuine pedophile, who're capable of loving children as only pedophiles can do.

                         Human life is precious and unique, human consciousness and awareness are precious and unique, and children are <u>especially</u> precious and unique. And, there are so many possibilities and options out there that only <u>wait</u> for you to grab them and exploit them. There are so many children out there who are in dire need of adult friendships and love, there are so many children out there who think sex is exciting and something they would like to explore, even with strangers.

                         If you die, there are so much things that will be just wasted, so much that I can't even explain it. So please stop at once considering leaving us!

                         One of those enormous challenges we meet everyday, is to accept a faith of never being able to fully experience romance and sex with a child, without having to break one of the biggest social taboos and forbidden laws on earth, and risk loosing everything that is important to us in life, which includes our families, friends, careers and freedom. And such a reality is very hard to swallow.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The first thing we will do to tackle this problem, is to take on our scientific goggles and take a good look at the <u>root</u> of this problem, and learn where it originates from and why it is here and affecting our lives as much as it does.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Romance and sex is an important feature within the human species that has its roots deeply planted into the human biology and evolution. The average human being has a <u>continuous</u> desire to practice romance and sex with sexually attractive partners. This makes a lot of babies, and that makes mother nature happy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you do what mother nature says, you will be rewarded with great pleasure as it happens, and a nice feeling of calm and relief for a certain while afterwards. These rewards are actually chemical drugs being produced and released from within your very own brain. However, If you don't do what mother nature says, you will be punished with frustration and depression until you do. And no drugs on you, my friend!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is the evolution at its best and its worst, and how our brains are wired to spread our genes and make as many babies as possible during our lifespan.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>Our</u> problem, as genuine pedophiles, is that mother nature doesn't care about what we are attracted to. Whether it is cross gender adults, children, babies, or even donkeys, she still demands us to fully practice our erotic desires.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And this explains our unfulfilled wishes and needs, which is a part of our very own genes and nature, making it very frustrating being a genuine pedophile. It is in our <u>very</u> genes and nature to practice romance and sex with children, but we are being held back by social norms and formal laws.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This is our reality, and this is what we're dealing with. So, let's take a look at some basic solutions to this challenge:

                         It is very important that you first of all note that it is fully possible to live a very rewarding and satisfying life without practicing sex with real children, while still getting lots of joy out of children and life itself as a genuine pedophile.

                         It is all about adapting to a different set of thinking and practice, by exploiting some neat tricks to give you better and more rewarding sexual releases, so you can much better please mother nature and her demands. By using your creativity, and thinking outside the box, you can actually find some legal treasures of pleasures out there; all of which we'll take a closer look at below.

Sexual urge is the basis for sexual frustration, which again is the basis for several related problems.

                         Second, if you <u>do</u> decide to practice child love with children, this can be done at several different levels; meaning all the way from fully legal interactions, to fully sexual intercourses with even young toddlers. There are lots of different options available at all these different levels, and you can push the limits pretty far before any laws get broken.

                         Masturbation is healthy and it releases a lot of those frustrations from not having a child to make love to. It really is your number one tool to handle sexual frustrations as a genuine pedophile.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Masturbation becomes especially important if you have children and temptations all around you, while not being able to have sex with them of various reasons.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         The most important thing about masturbation is to make sure that each one gets as intense as possible. This means avoiding quick and dry masturbations, like those one take in a shower in a cold and lifeless bathroom, as those really suck and won't help any frustrations nor depressions much.

                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         More intense masturbations are achieved by using masturbation techniques that will give you longer pleasures and stronger orgasms than usual.

                         A great technique that I've recommended lots of times, is to pull your foreskin all the way back, and then start rubbing the area right underneath your penis head gently, with some lubricants. This area is actually a special erogenous zone on the male penis that allows you to achieve such longer masturbations and harder orgasms. Optionally, use a smooth tool or toy instead of your fingers to gently rub this area.

                         <br />
                         
                         To make the orgasms even greater; each time you feel that you're about to ejaculate, stop the rubbing and wait until the penis gets less potent. Then start all over again, and repeat this as much as you can, until your penis finally explodes.

                         You may also use other techniques to prolong your masturbation sessions, like using a feather or a piece of clothing to tickle your penis head over a longer period, until it finally explodes into a strong orgasm.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The more you prolong your masturbation sessions, the greater the orgasms and rewards become. And, if you do that a lot, you will actually fool mother nature to believe that you live a very sexually satisfying life, thus you will gradually feel less sexually frustrated and depressed with time.

                         However, just expansing your physical masturbation isn't enough to really make your pedophilic sex life greater. You will also need to expand it <u>mentally</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This means expanding your <u>fantasies</u> as well, which is usually achieved by great visual stimulations.
                         
                         <br />

                         Many genuine pedophiles use child pornography to stimulate their fantasies, which it does in many ways. But legal no-nude media of children can actually stimulate your fantasy even better than pure and simple pornography. It exists of a <u>much</u> greater quantity and quality on the Internet as well, which can make you feel much safer and better about yourself, especially if you're a concerned or conservative pedophile.

                         Just use <span class="red">duckduckgo.com</span> to search for "photo communities", and you will find various of such communities containing lots of stupid parents with expensive photo equipment who share lots of pictures of their stunningly beautiful toddlers and children, with closeups of their beautiful faces and red lips, some even in makeup and being partially nude, some even crying, and in many different clothings and body positions.

                         It can also be pictures of your own children, children within your family, your neighbors children, children from the daycare facility or school you may work at, or pictures that you've taken by yourself outdoors,

                         You may then pretend through fantasy, while using the latter masturbation technique, that the child you are watching is licking and sucking on your penis, or exploring it in a flimsy way with its small hands. Concentrate on the children, by looking deeply into their eyes, while fantasizing like this.

                         Such great visual stimuli combined with deep fantasies, while masturbating in the recommended ways, will together give your whole body lots of great pleasures, along with a very satisfying and happy sex life as a <u>masturbating</u> pedophile.

                         Don't forget that there are lots of cool sex toys out there that can mimic mouths and tight holes, which of course are legal to buy and will help your fantasies become even more real.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Reversed state techniques are also interesting, meaning that you pretend to be the child you are watching. You may use sex toys to stimulate or penetrate yourself, and pretend that you can feel the same nice feelings as the child does if you have had sex with her or him. You can even pretend being molested. I know, it may sound strange, but many pedophiles get a positive psychological response from doing that, with some very interesting and controversial pleasures.

                         And for God's sake <u>no</u>; you are not a looser or anything like that for doing stuff like this. Even the most active pedophiles out there who have regular sex with kids, are also using these techniques to add something positive to their lives.

                         You never get too old to play with dolls. Just as with children and <u>their</u> dolls, the possibilities and fantasies are <u>endless</u>.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Children dolls can be really good substitutes for real children, and are usually very underestimated play toys for pedophiles. I've recommended it so many times, and most people have given me positive feedback.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Dolls are even really good additions for those who already practice child love with real children. This is because little dollies can become very realistic, while always being ready and willing to be your slaves when your kids aren't around.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The most real and cute dolls will really fool your brain into believing that they are real children, making the sexual pleasure, excitement, release and final reward extremely close to as if they actually <u>had</u> been real children.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The more engagement and money you put into this, the closer you will get to real high-level child love practice, without braking <u>one</u> single law.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Dolls can be bought at most toy stores, but these are usually less realistic and very small. But if you look thoroughly around, espeically worldwide via Internet, you can find some interesting dolls here and there.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Special doll manufacturers and artists create more realistic children dolls, more like true children replicas with glass eyes and real children hair. The quality and realism of these dolls are usually linked to their prices, which goes all the way from $1000 to $10000, and some even higher. But an expensive children doll can become extremely nice to cuddle with, and can feel like a real child of yours, whom <u>never</u> grows up(!).
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, if you are really low on budget, you could always pad children clothes with soft padding, so you get the appropriate basic shape and a mass that emulates a real child. Then make a hole at the right places, optionally inserted with sex toys, and interesting things can happen.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Why not give your new doll its own room, with its own bed, which you can visit at nights? Why not buy them sweet clothes, do their hair, and paint their nails?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're able to, you can secretly create some seriously aesthetic and sexual environments with dolls. Like, having a secret room with a large collection of dolls, using special lighting, and audio of children laughter and songs. It has a powerful mixture of creepiness and erotics that is hard to explain to anyone who haven't yet experienced it firsthand, which can become a little pedo heaven, so to speak.

                         <br />

                         I still remember it as clearly as if it was yesterday, the day I was very young and for the very first time found a used pantie from my 4 year old niece in my sisters laundry basket.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         I smelled the hottest smell in my life from that yellowish area in that dirty pink Barbie pantie. I immediately began to masturbate, and came harder than ever before. I thought about the sweet child, and could even hear her play outside the bathroom door, while I did it. And, it was <u>heaven</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you have kids in your family, or among friends and neighbors, I really recommend trying to find these marvels. They can actually become pretty exciting to search for.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Smelling vaginas and bums from many different children, through their used and dirty panties, while masturbating yourself and thinking about them, or looking at their pictures, is nothing less than incredibly hot.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Be careful about stealing too many panties though, because if used kiddie panties disappear from people's houses after you have visited them, it won't look good.

                         <br />

                         Another enormous <b class="h">challenge</b> is to feel like an outsider in our society, especially among family, friends and colleagues. Since most people are teleiophiles who live and thrive in adult relationships, and glorify such relationships, you can never be yourself fully when socializing with the wast majority.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This may initially sound like a trivial problem, but it really isn't. It's really hard being fundamentally different from all the people who surround your life, making you feel like an alien; which may cause something that's called 'paradoxical loneliness' within psychology, meaning that you feel lonely even though having several people close in your life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It can become especially hard being a male among other male friends, as male friends very often talk about adult women in a romantic and sexual context when meeting up together. This will make you feel even more as an outsider, not to mention even less comfortable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Many genuine pedophiles are also living non-traditional lives. They simply don't appreciate intimate and romantic relationships with any adults, so they end up as permanent singles, which usually raises some attention among others; and usually leads to some kind of pressure from family and friends as you grow older, a pressure to find yourself an adult partner and start raising a family like everyone <u>else</u> does.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you now add an above-usual interest for children, and being very active with kids in general, while having no wife nor kids of your own, the oddness can quickly increase dangerously towards negative suspicions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, this problem will depend a lot on where you live, as social oddness will be much more visible in a small Christian town of fearful residents, contrary to a large city that's already occupied by lots of people and oddities to blend with.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Nevertheless, this problem is still hard to escape fully, wherever you live and whoever you are. So once again, lets start tackling this problem by taking on our scientific goggles:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The human brain is hardwired to detect even the slightest abnormality in social groups. This is an primeval evolutionary advantage, as it lets us easily and quickly notice different and thus potentially dangerous people in our social group. So, if anyone sticks out from the wast majority, even just slightly, he or she will thus be clearly noticed by the rest of the group.

                         Our brains are also hardwired to prefer people who are fundamentally similar to ourselves, and reject everyone else who aren't. This leads to a natural gathering of people with similar interests and traits, which also means a social exclusion of people who're different from that gathering.

                         This is a part of our biology and evolution as humans, and why most genuine pedophiles <u>feel</u> like outsiders and excluded from most social groups, as a result of drawing negative attention to themselves by not living their lives as everyone else does.

                         Being an outsider can quickly lead to social withdrawal, which again can quickly lead to loneliness and depression; and there you have that dark hole and deep well again.

                         Even though it can become mentally stressful to pretend being someone whom you fundamentally aren't, sometimes this can be a better solution than being an apparent oddity in your local society who attracts negative attention to himself.

                         This is fully possible and doable by just following a few and simple advices, which should be tried if yet haven't.

                         It usually makes you fit much better within the standards of your local society and its expected social norms, and makes you way more comfortable among other people, while other people will feel more comfortable among you as well.

                         It is all about being <u>aware</u> of this being just a masquerade, and not being the reality. It is all about fooling your local social group and gaining control over yourself and others. Thus, it is <u>not</u> about trying to forget nor erase who you really are.

                         A great start to make yourself fit better within the average society as a genuine pedophile, is to buy some adult porn, and then do a bad job at hiding it in your own quarters. This will make other people easily see that you're obviously sexually interested in the adult opposite gender, which will become a very good basis for your social masquerade.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         This is especially effective for males who have other male friends over for regular visits. But, you may startle your parents a little bit too, whom will pretend that they don't like it, but in reality feel a huge relief inside themselves when you pretty much confirm that you're not a sexual deviant after all.

                         <br />

                         The importing thing however, is not to overdo this. Don't fill your quarters full of porn magazines and movies, as in pushing it onto your visitors. They may then think that there's something wrong with you, or even think that it's all staged.

                         You may of course build a large collection to make this more reliable, but hide it until someone asks to see it. Just have a couple of magazines or DVDs laying around, like you accidentally forgot to hide them after you last used them.

                         Of course, hard porn is sleazy. If you are a sophisticated person with high social status among sophisticated friends, you may want to use soft porn instead.

                         <br />

                         You may also want to visit some adult porn sites on your computer as well, or even on your smartphone, and don't delete the usage history. But doing so at work may cause problems, so be careful about this.

                         This isn't just a great start to convince other people that you're a teleiophile, it's also ridiculously easy. It does cost money of course, but it's well worth the price you pay for it.

                         This is a great method to use when you are out with your friends, like in a city in the summer, or at a bar or a party.

                         It is really simple: just make a hit on a few females now and then, while acting less attractive yourself. This will make you <u>seem</u> interested in females, in the same time as rejections become an almost certainty.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This will <u>additionally</u> increase your respect and popularity, and general social status, especially among male friends.

                         It initially requires a lot of bravery for teleiophiles to flirt with strangers, because of the fear of being rejected. But, since you actually <u>aim</u> for rejections, and know that this is just a charade, it actually becomes much easier than you think.

                         Just make sure that you don't act too much like a dirt bag, or else you may obtain a negative reputation in that area.

                         The whole idea is to make a terrible first impression with a creepy pickup line while your friends observe you from a certain distance, being not able to hear you.

                         Personally, I prefer starting the introduction by asking her if she's single, because it's usually a bad idea to firth with taken females in drinking environments. Such a pickup line might just as well be enough to make her turn away regardless.

                         But if she doesn't, my next favorite question is to ask her if she likes to drink much. If she asks why you're wondering about that, tell her that you've been watching her from a distance and think that she drinks a little bit too much, and suggest that she reduces her alcohol intake some.

                         If you're in a non-alcohol environment, you may instead tell her that when watching her from a distance, she looks a little bit unsteady and influenced by alcohol.
                         
                         <br />

                         If she smokes, tell her to quit, and tell her that it's <u>really</u> stupid to destroy herself by smoking.

                         A more complicated method of emulating teleiophilia, but also an extremely effective and convincing one, is to show an obvious interest in dating the adult opposite gender.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Your first option is to not date anyone at all, but instead lie to your family and friends about having dated this and that, but just say it didn't work out. Optionally, make up some funny stories about weird dates. And then keep on doing this into the unseeing future.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Lying about it is really the easiest and most convenient way. But, if you one day get caught for lying about something like that, or even suspected for doing it, people will ask themselves: ehm why does he lie about something like this? And, most fairly intelligent people will quickly draw the conclusion that you're pretending to be someone you aren't, and that means pretending to be a teleiophile(!).
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Unless you know for sure that you are a really good lier and manipulator, I always recommend not lying about this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Your second option is to actually go through with the dating to make it all look more reliable, but carefully sabotage the date so the date will quickly loose interest and want to leave.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Sabotaging a date can be done in various ways, but the best way is to be very redrawn and quiet. This won't demand anything from you, all you have to do is to just let <u>her</u> do all the talking, and give very short and enclosing answers to all her questions. When she doesn't talk, just concentrate on your diner and be as quiet as possible. The few times you do choose to talk, just talk about boring things, like the weather.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the silence approach isn't your thing, another way to sabotage a date is to be a very self-centered person who only enjoy talking about himself, and shows an obvious less interest for the date and her life. When she talks about herself, interrupt her and start talking about yourself instead.

                         Believe me, most females just hate this!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Being a dirt bag is also an option, but this can quickly give you a bad reputation, and even reveal that you're actually sabotaging. This can become quite embarrassing as well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         There is however the danger of meeting a female whom actually likes quiet, self-centered or unpleasant guys, but these are the very minority of females.

                         The majority of your dates won't be seen nor heard from again. And you just don't know what went wrong, complaining to your friends that you'll never find yourself a nice women, crying on your moms shoulder, and so forth.
                         
                         <br />

                         You don't have to date all that many women either, just one person every second or third month.

                         If you want to go all the way with emulating teleiophilia, there's only one thing to do, and that is to find yourself an adult partner of the opposite gender, and try making a life together.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This can sound like a really scary concept for a genuine pedophile, but it doesn't have to be all that frighting nor unpleasant after all, as it mostly depend on the actual adult.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you're young and hot, slim and strong, and with nice thick movie star hair on your head, you should be able to easily capture a quite young and sweet looking woman, with a sweet and humble personality.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, if you're more like me, middle aged, with thin hair and averagely looking, it can be difficult finding young and sweet females. Unless of course, they got some baggage that other males aren't interested in. Such baggage can be unpleasant in the end, like mental illnesses, personal problems, or just a very unpleasant personality. But it can also be a bunch of kids(!).
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         And speaking of which, by looking for and choosing single moms to establish teleiophile relationships with, you'll be killing two birds with one stone: finding yourself a woman, thus blending fully with the majority, and having sweet children to caress and seduce, thus having sex with kids.

                         If you do find yourself a women without any baggage nor any kids, why not establishing a family of your own, by making your very own children with her?

                         When it comes to adult relationships as pedophiles, it's not only about the persons looks, it is just as much about its personality. You may find a not that great looking female, but she can have a very sweet and childish personality, which will appeal to your pedophilic sexual orientation. and thus make her more attractive and doable than average females.

                         Try spending as much time with adults as you do with kids. When using little to no time with adults, and lots of time with children, negative attention and suspicions might occur.

                         Blend in with the majority as much as you can and can stand.

                         Remind yourself that this isn't you, this is an act, this is a masquerade, and that <u>you</u> are in control of your life, and that <u>you</u> control others; all of which can make you feel good.

                         Most importantly: the more you blend into social groups, the more trust you will gain from most people in those groups, and the easier access to their children you will get(!).

                         Social relationships, and how they will affect you as a genuine pedophile, will depend on your own social status and needs:

                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you're a very good looking person with a high social status, with lots of similar friends, tricks like these will become very important to perform regularly. Such environments have high standards and expectations to all the participants.

                         If you're not that good looking, if you don't have much of friends, and especially if you don't have high social needs, you will get away with far less struggle and masquerade.

                         Friendship and support is especially important to pedophiles. Unfortunately, most pedophiles can't turn to their real life family or friends with their problems, because so many people think that all pedophiles are bad people who rape children, as pedophilia is still a highly misunderstood subject in the average society. So, telling people that you're a pedophile is a huge risk to take, which is why most people don't do that.

                         However, thanks to anonymous Internet services like Tor, pedophiles are nowadays able to seek friends and support, which is very important whether you're having personal problems or not. It's important to be able to express what you feel in these communities, and get responses from other people who feel exactly like you feel.

                         However strange it may sound to a genuine pedophile, who does everything he can to hide and lock away his unpopular sexual orientation from the rest of the world, there are actually pedophiles out there who are considering unveiling their orientation to their closest family or friends.

                         <br />

                         Most pedophiles who are considering this, do it because they just have to get it out of their chests and off their shoulders. They are in dire need of having someone hugging them and supporting them, because they can't handle their sexual orientation by themselves anymore. They just want a real life friend to support them, which no Internet community can do.

                         <br />

                         Other pedophiles consider doing it because they feel a need to be open about it. They want to stand proudly by their different sexual orientation and prove that being a pedophile doesn't <u>have</u> to mean that you're a predator or monster. They want people to associate pedophilia with a kind and ordinary person, like themselves. They want to change the world.

                         There's just one big problem with telling another person that you're a genuine pedophile, and that is not knowing how that person will react to it. You may get a warm hug and a special friend for the rest of your life, but you may also get a slap over your face and end up indefinitely excluded from your family or friends. It's almost like playing Russian Roulette with your own character and social life.

                         My general advice is <u>not</u> to tell about it; and the reason why, leads to an important question: why does anyone <u>have</u> to know about it?
                         
                         <br />

                         If you want to become a pedophile martyr, as in putting a nice face on pedophilia and contribute to openness around the subject, it won't really benefit the world much. You will only risk loosing a lot more than anyone will ever gain from it.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you need to tell about it so other people can protect their children from you, if you feel that you can't control yourself, it would be much better for everyone if you took an alternate route to solve that problem; like learning how to control your urges and sexual orientation, which this handbook will teach you, or just leave the people whom you're afraid of hurting.

                         <br />

                         If you are doing it out of pure need for sympathy, and that only, still don't do it. You will only feel relived for a short while, but from that point everything will change. People will most likely never look at you in the same way again. You may gradually loose friendships and closeness to other people over time, even though they handled it well at the time of being told about it. Rarely anything good comes out of it in the end, except for those 10 minutes of relief, which afterwards may put you in an even worse situation, forever.

                         And, there are no guarantees that this information won't leak, and leak into your local community, neighbors, school or work, and so forth. And before you know it, you'll get graffiti art on your house and car.

                         You should think <u>very</u> wisely about this; pedophilia has way too negative roots planted way too deep into the soil of our society and culture. Most people are simply not ready to hear that someone they love is a pedophile whom craves sexually for innocent children; it's simply a little bit too much for most.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Maybe this can be more safely done sometime in the future, if our society and culture becomes intelligent enough to handle this subject intellectually and sensible. As for present time, this is not the era to be open about pedophilia.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, if you're sitting with a gun to your head and just two options to choose from: telling about it or taking your own life, you shouldn't loose anything by telling about it.

                         <br />

                         But try thinking more sensible about this:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you really need to let it out of your chest and off your shoulders to another real life human being, try finding an out-of-town therapist instead. I mean, if Internet support forums for pedophiles isn't enough, seek professional help in real life instead of putting this onto your family and friends.

                         In my line of work, I've seen too many pedophiles who decided to tell about their sexual orientation to people whom they loved and trusted. They where told that they could tell them <u>anything</u>, it was alright! But as soon as the word pedophile was mentioned, there where suddenly no more sympathy around, and things just went from bad to worse.

                         Even though people love you and you love them back, and you trust them with your life, the word 'pedophile' is so misunderstood and so hated that it's almost worse than the word 'serial killer'.

                         When it comes to challenges related to genuine pedophilia, it is crucial to shift your focus from negative to positive, thus focus on what's possible, rather than what's impossible. It is crucial to focus on how to get <u>pass</u> any obstacles in your way, rather than just focusing on the obstacles themselves. It is crucial to focus on the children whom you love, and all the joys and pleasures they can provide you, whether being legal or illegal, instead of sitting there all alone and depressed.

                         The world isn't a perfect place, and it really is unfair. Some people are born into perfectness and happiness with few to none obstacles in life, while others are born into misery and sorrow where every day is a struggle to survive.

                         There are hundreds of thousands of other pedophiles worldwide who feel exactly like you do, if not millions. I've been struggling with challenges myself, all the way since my own childhood when I discovered my lust for young children at the age of 11 or so. So, you're not alone.

                         There are additional people out there who suffer from other problems as well, being even worse than pedophilia. There are people put there who have severe mental illnesses, who are paralyzed from their necks and down, and can't move around at all. Some people are suffering slow and painful deaths due to mortal illnesses. Some people have lost their whole families and children in tragic accidents.

                         If you can wake up in the morning as an otherwise well and active person, get up on your own feet, see the sun and hear the birds and the wind, feel sand and water between your toes, experience the beauty, innocence and laughter from children, you have so many reasons to be happy. There are so many opportunities and possibilities in front of you. You have so many reasons to live your life.

                         If you have already decided to take suicide, no matter what anyone says, and it's irreversible, do yourself the great favor and make love to at least <u>one</u> child before you leave us. Make love to as many children as possible before you leave. Maybe that first sexual intercourse will change your mind?
