                         My first and very best recommendation for finding children is to find and engage romantic relationships with single moms. Or single dads, of course.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The basis for this recommendation is the high amount of unique advantages, and the low amount of disadvantages. And, that all the advantages are extremely nice and suitable for most pedophiles in most life situations.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I will now go through all the advantages and disadvantages, which will give you a good idea about what this is all about:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="advantages"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub1">Advantages</span>
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">Availability</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Statistics prove that about half of all romantic relationships between adult heterosexuals, end sooner or later.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most of these relationships include children, and the moms usually get primary custody rights.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Many single moms are therefore looking for new partners, either actively or passively, leaving a lot of single moms with children available out there for pedophiles to exploit.

                         Being a single mom has its fair share of disadvantages and challenges in the modern society:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There are lots of responsibilities and tasks to handle <u>all</u> by themselves. It becomes economically harder to make ends meet. And they will increasingly miss the comfort and security from having a male in their lives, and in their homes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Their biggest miss will be a male partner who loves them, takes care of them, protects them, and gives their children the same things along with a male role model; a miss that becomes an instinctive priority for most single moms to fill.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         But, it is <u>also</u> difficult being a single mom on the dating market, especially with lots of snooty brats in her baggage. Because most men who look for new female relationships, do actually prefer females <u>without</u> children, as stepchildren means several disadvantages and challenges for most males.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some single moms may have even <u>further</u> disadvantages on the dating market that makes them even less attractive, like poorness, wrong age and generally bad looks.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         By 'wrong age', I mean single moms who are either too young or too old, as either are very little attractive among average adult men.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some single moms actually give up searching all together, or don't even search at all, because of the low self-esteem such negative factors create.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         So, where does this leave us pedophiles?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                  
                         Some single moms can have so many disadvantages on the dating market that they rarely, or even not at all, get any responses from any men. The men won't bother contacting them nor replying to any of their messages.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This can quickly lead to desperation, making it potentially easy for us pedophiles to exploit their strong hunger for male attention and love, and their fear of eternal loneliness, to quickly gain their trust and engage a relationship with them.

                         <br />
                         
                         Not to mention, snooty brats is <u>exactly</u> what we want. We want to lick all their snoot off, and clean those snooty faces with our tongues. Well, at least <u>I</u> do.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         So, it isn't all that hard for pedophiles to find a pretty decent single moms with several stunningly beautiful kids, without having any especially good looks nor high status themselves.
                         
                         <br />

                         Some of these moms can be <u>pretty</u> nasty, but then again offer an even easier access to some seriously hot offspring.

                         When using Internet dating services to find single moms, which is recommended for ease and convenience, you can actually search for kids without having to leave your computer and the comfort and safety of your own home.

                         <br />

                         Internet is stuffed with dating services. Just use an Internet search engine or ask your family and friends about recommended services.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         You can actually start as of right <u>now</u>, and potentially find yourself several candidates within the next hour of searching.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most of these services have convenient search engines that let you easily add specific criteria to find specific matches, like listing all single females of a specific age group who have children, and optionally live somewhere around <u>your</u> area.

                         <br />

                         You may instead or additionally use newspapers and magazines that got dating ad sections.

                         Dating services are like <b class="h">shopping malls</b> for pedophiles, with a high volume and variety of single moms, and each one potentially having several stunningly looking children that can later be seduced within very ideal circumstances.

                         This method makes you able to actually search for children as a pedophile without raising any negative suspicions, because finding oneself an adult partner for a romantic relationship is as normal as it can possibly get.

                         It will additionally boost your own social status as an average, straight and teleiophile man who are very serious, mature and responsible.

                         You can very safely and comfortably meet lots of different children with this method, and meet as many children as you want to before making any final decisions about their moms.

                         And of course, the moms themselves are usually very safe and comfortable to meet in the first place.

                         If you are low on resources yourself, like having little to no money and no nice places to live, but you're otherwise <u>personally</u> resourceful, leaching on single moms is <u>one</u> neat way to kill two birds with one stone:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you treat and spoil a single mom well, you may end up living comfortably at her home and being well fed, for free, while being alone with her kids and 'watching them' while the mom works. And what could be better than that? 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Believe me when i say that this is <u>fully</u> possible; because any single mom's wet dream is to have a partner who gets up in the morning when she does, and makes her a nice and romantic breakfast while she's making herself ready in the bathroom. While she's at work, he is home with her children and 'taking care of them' so she don't have to pay for a nanny or daycare, or bother her family and friends. And when she finally comes home from work, all tired and hungry, a nice and warm diner awaits her, with a nice dessert, and a foot massage while she watches her favorite TV shows; in an all clean home with an all empty laundry basket.

                         And with full access to children 6-8 hours each and every day, of various ages, a lot of opportunities will open in front of you.

                         If you find the <u>right</u> single mom, whom trusts you enough to leave you alone with her children, you will gain <u>easy</u> access to children for <u>any</u> level of child love practice; even babies and toddlers, which otherwise would be pretty hard to access.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It may be a poor and hardworking single mom with bad looks, who works shifts, leaving you often home alone in her trailer park home, with her children, even through nights.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Being left alone with her children will usually happen anyway, with enough time of building confidence and trust.

                         If the relationship doesn't turn out like you wanted it to, or you just want something new after while, like new, fresh and younger kids, it will be easy to leave them and start all over.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Without any true responsibilities nor legal obligations towards the family, it is just to say goodbye whenever you see fit, and you won't have to see them ever again.

                         And for each time you do this, you will gain more experience, and things will go generally smoother with each go.

                         It may be easy searching for and finding single moms, but it sure does require some work and effort dating them, while having to expose yourself in unique ways.

                         And when finally getting there: being a full time partner and stepparent will require some general hard work and responsibilities if you want to stick around for a while. You may have to become a true soccer dad who drives all over the place with screaming and fighting children in the backseat, along with all their equipment.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Even though if your primary goal is to get intimate with the <u>children</u> of your selected family, while not being all that interested in anything else, you will <u>still</u> have to make a decent effort to make it look like your primary goal is to be a serious partner and stepparent.

                         <br />

                         There are even more challenges and work that you will have to pay to gain access to the things you really want.

                         This new partner of yours will most likely both expect and require a relationship on a romantic and sexual level, meaning that you must <u>perform</u> on this level to be able to stay in the relationship on a longterm basis.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Emulating a romantic interest is <u>initially</u> easy, as all it takes are regular kisses during the days, and some surprise flowers and chocolates now and then.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, emulating a <u>sexual</u> interest can become a true challenge for some pedophile men, as an erection is obviously needed to successfully complete a sexual intercourse. And it may become especially difficult getting one when being with a very unattractive partner.

                         It may additionally become psychologically challenging to force yourself to be intimate with someone whom you don't want to be intimate with at all, on a longterm basis.

                         But there <u>are</u> some ways to overcome these challenges, which I will teach you all about during the upcoming <b class="h">instructions</b> in this chapter.

                         I can't emphasize enough how much I recommend this method of finding children. It has <u>so</u> many important advantages, with just a few disadvantages.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, these few disadvantages <u>are</u> kind of big, and may seem a little bit too big for some of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But in the end, I think all these advantages really outweighs the disadvantages, especially if you think about what all this can potentially give you in return.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Even though this method seems non-doable to you at this point, it's still worth <u>trying</u> it. If you haven't tried it before, you can't tell for sure what the outcome will be. You may actually become surprised! And there's very little to loose by just trying it carefully out, step by step, as this chapter teaches.

                         It will be generally nice to have a family with children around. It's especially nice to have a family with children in the holiday seasons, like Christmas and birthdays.

                         As most instructions in this handbook, these are based on real life experiences from many different pedophiles.

                         Before you start searching for single moms, you should first think a little bit about what you want and don't want.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         This will make your searching more efficient, while avoiding putting yourself in unfortunate situations that usually lead to regrets and waste of both time and resources.

                         <span class="sub2">One Stepchild or Several?</span>

                         <br />

                         One stepchild is recommended, especially for beginners; because several stepchildren may share bedroom and mostly play together, making it harder for you to be alone with just one child, aka your favorite, for longer periods of time.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         And with several kids, you may end up with this annoying sibling who's always in the way.

                         <br />

                         Though, several children <u>may</u> give you a little harem along with several choices and options. It may even give you group child love practice, as in group kiddie sex. And few things in life beat that. However, this is usually reserved for the pros.

                         Single parents with babies are more rare, but then again the least likely ones to find an interested partner anytime soon. Few to none average men want screaming babies around their new partners, and be second priorities to the babies.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Babies and young toddlers will give you many years into the future of warm and delicious pleasures and joys, and they are especially important choices for nepiophiles.

                         <br />

                         Unfortunately, such young kids are usually very protected by and dependent on their moms, contrary to older children. This makes them harder to be alone with for longer periods, and it usually requires a significant amount of time to build enough trust to be finally able to do so.

                         The older the kids, the more likely you will be able to spend 'quality time' with them without mommy being around.

                         Increased mobility, especially if you're able to move from your current location, will make a lot more single moms, children and general options become available to you.

                         Most pedophiles who do this, want short-term relationships, for the sake of freedom and easiness to leave whenever they see fit. This gives them continuously fresh and new kids by regularly changing families.

                         <br />
                         
                         By 'short-term' in this regard, I don't mean just a few days or weeks, but rather a few years; without establishing oneself too much, like with marriage and/or pregnancy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Though, you can make it a longterm relationship if this is what you prefer; which makes it wise to aim for marriage and pregnancy, as this will tie you closer to your selected family, along with greater responsibilities and legal obligations.

                         And by making her pregnant, she will gradually <u>shift</u> her focus to her pregnancy and eventually newborn, giving you more room and possibilities to fiddle with your stepchildren.

                         As already stated, there are lots of Internet dating services available. Use some time to go thoroughly through those you find, and see what options they provide.

                         Why not use several dating sites at once?

                         When you're ready to create a profile, try to give the viewers a great impression of yourself by including these elements:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <ul>
                                                            
                                   <li>You're a serious, responsible and mature person.</li>
                                   
                                   <li>Your future partner will have your highest priority in life.</li>
                                   
                                   <li>You want a longterm relationship.</li>
                                   
                                   <li>You adore children, and would like to establish a family.</li>
                                   
                                   <li>You will love and care for any stepchild as your own.</li>
                                             
                              </ul>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Make sure you don't show too much interest in and write too much about <u>children</u>, as this may reveal your true intentions. Just give it a couple of sentences at maximum.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And always write that you want a longterm relationship, even though if you really plan on short-term, as this will make you more attractive among single moms.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You should generally keep your profile as lightweight, clean, and easy to read as possible. It should be kind of like a good sales ad, as in selling yourself and your positive traits in a quick but informative way. This should make your profile very appealing and easily readable among single moms who quickly travel through lots of ads.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Ideally, add a nice picture of yourself. But <u>not</u> a picture of you sitting on the hood of a Ferrari, but <u>rather</u> a picture of you in your garden or at a nice place in the woods while hiking. Optionally, rent yourself a professional photographer who will help you create some awesome profile pictures.

                         <br />

                         <br />

                         You may also ask your family and friends for further advices regarding your profile, as <u>they</u> know you well and will most likely be happy to help you out.

                         As soon as your new profile has been created and activated, it is time to search for other people's profiles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And this is where the real fun begins!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Most Internet dating services allow you to <u>search</u> through their databases of other profiles, to find a 'perfect match' based on lots of different and interesting criteria.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some sites let you do free option based searches, so you can just tick a lot of check boxes. Other sites will give you lots of questions to answer. And based on these criteria, all the singles who match you should become available.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The criteria for having children should be available, which is a neat method of quickly finding single moms. If it isn't, you will just have to search deeper and longer to find them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But, it is <u>also</u> important to find a match based on other and general criteria too. You do want a partner that matches you well in general, so you will go well along together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Though, a strict match isn't all that required if you have a round personality and are able to compromise a lot. You may find some children who are extremely attractive and suitable, thus giving <u>them</u> some priority over their moms.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Don't care too much about choosing 'the right one' at <u>first</u>, as your initial searches are all about going through profile after profile, with lots of patience, and creating many bookmarks of everyone whom you might think is of any interest. You will afterwards investigate every bookmark for further sorting.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It may scare you some, looking through what may be lots of middle aged and not so attractive single moms. But stay on your quest and give it a fair chance. Their <u>children</u> are your true goal and what you're really searching for here.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Not all single parents share pictures of their children on their profile pages. But you usually get their pictures eventually, after having made that first contact and having communicated some. You should probably not ask about it too soon, as that may raise a red flag, thus wait until <u>she</u> decides to share them. This can become a difficult process that needs some careful and gentle steps with lots of patience. But, it is worth it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         What's really important now, is to look for <u>certain</u> types of single moms, to make it as easy as possible for you to get your hands on their children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The ideal single mom would be a hard working and preferably young female with many kids, who lives in a trailer park or a poor community with low income, and especially works at evenings and nights. Well, you may have to settle for a not so young female, as long as she has important weaknesses.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Those who live in non-urban areas, like in a God forgotten countryside somewhere, are also usually more naive and trusting compared to those who live in big cities.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         By already having a registered profile, single moms will now be able to search for <u>you</u> as well. Or, someone will get a new match when logging in after you registered. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, you may also be contacted by <u>them</u> while searching.

                         When you get to the point of contacting a single mom through a dating service for the very first time, it is important to sweep her off her feet, and give her a great first-impression of yourself, by following some important guidelines for the mail.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Always contact them by mail first, not by phone or SMS. Letters will always be the most romantic and mysterious; while allowing you to calmly and carefully craft s special letter that will melt their hearts completely.
                         
                         <br />

                         Here are the recommended guidelines for the first mail:

                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <ol>
                         
                                   <li>Compliment her profile.</li>
                                   <li>Say that you think her profile matches you as a person.</li>
                                   <li>Compliment her personality, from her self-description.</li>
                                   <li>Compliment her kids, <u>if</u> there are pictures of them.</li>
                                   <li>Tell her that she seems like a great and loving mom.</li>
                                   <li>Tell her that you need a nice woman like her in your life.</li>
                                   <li>Tell some about yourself.</li>
                                             
                              </ol>

                         <br />
                         
                         Remember not to overdo this. Try to find a comfortable balance between being too much and too little engaged; which also goes for the compliments, as too many and too intense compliments may cause you to appear phony.

                         And when telling about yourself, just use your own profile as a basis, along with the previous <a class="set3" href="#link1" target="_blank">recommendations</a> that you followed when you created it. Neither overdo this part.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Generally, appear as a positive and happy person, and don't be afraid of using some moderate sense of humor.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                         
                                                  
                         Most single moms who are struggling in life, and struggling with finding a new partner especially, will absorb compliments like dry sponges absorb water. They will also be little to no critical and suspicious towards you, and be generally nice to deal with. Thus, these are the females to look out for and keep your focus on; and the ones to exploit as much as possible to reach your final goal, which is the nude and warm skin and genitals of their sweet children.

                         The more desperate and engaged they appear, the better candidates they are.

                         When you finally get to the point of actually meeting a single mom in real life for the very first time, things will first of all become pretty exciting. But it will also become very important to make some initial observations.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         I personally recommend that you suggest meeting up for the first time at a public restaurant for a nice diner on <u>your</u> treat. This will make you seem very decent, serious and mature, while it's also considered as good security practice to meet unknown people for the firs time at public locations.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         You usually don't meet the children during the first meeting, though there are a few exceptions out there: if you <u>are</u> being invited to e.g. their home for a diner, along with the children, you may always consider that of course. But it may become pretty stressful having to deal with lots of people at once, not to mention less secure. But it <u>will</u> be a very efficient way to decide if this family is worth using more time on or not.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As I initially wrote, it is very important to make some initial observations during this first date:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         
                         Your first observation will be all about seeing how well you go along with your new date, as this is a person you will potentially share several years with into the future.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It's important that you at least feel initially comfortable with the person, and that you're able to have effortless conversations. If you additionally share some interests and have the same sense of humor, it will be even better.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And this would be a clear sign of this date being a good candidate to further explore.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         However, if the opposite is the case, you will need to make a decision based on its severity. Thus, you must ask yourself if <u>this</u> is the person you really want to meet again and spend more time with. And if not, you will probably not want to spend years with her, <u>especially</u> not become intimate with her.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         When you finally meet the children for the first time, you will have to make the same observations with them:

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         As you have already learned in this handbook, a nice <a class="set3" href="chemistry.html#start" target="_blank">chemistry</a> between adults and children is <u>crucial</u> for successful and secure sex practice:

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you sense that the children don't like you, or they seem very little interested, that's usually a bad sign. If they look shy, but smile at you while looking curious, then you might have something nice going on. If they adore you from early on and eat you up, that's usually a very good sign.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It's important for a single mom that her new male likes her children and gives them attention, which obviously won't be a problem for a pedophile. However, make sure you don't overdo it, as that may look suspicious. 

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Just don't judge the situation too hard at first. Remember that the first meeting will always be affected by some nerves and uncertainties from all parties, which can lead to some tension and restrictions.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you end up unsure about things after the first meeting, whether being about the date, her children, or all at once, it doesn't hurt meeting up a couple of more times before making any important or final decisions.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you finally find a date whom turns out to be a success, as in finding a likable date with beautiful and likable children, and everything feels good, an <u>establishment</u> of a new relationship will sooner or later happen.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This is usually a very gradual process, as you will first meet several more times for diners and other family activities, while gradually becoming a more intimate part of the family.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But one day, an establishment will happen, which you <u>must</u> be prepared for and know how to handle:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="the_consummation"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">The Consummation</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The consummation of the relationship is the three-headed monster that you will one day have to fight with bare hands, and the monster that scares the heck out of most genuine pedophiles, especially if your new partner is less attractive. Because, this means becoming intimate with an adult, as in having a sexual intercourse with the mom. *Eek*
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This usually happens sometime into the relationship, as a part of an obvious romantic diner, made by <u>her</u> to really consummate your new relationship and make it sort of official; almost like a human mating ritual, which is actually is.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There are many factors that make such events very different from each other, making it hard for me to make just one advice that will fit everyone:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Your own sexual experience and tolerance towards adults will have a huge impact on this event, as in how well you will be able to perform sexually and (pretend to) enjoy it.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The age and looks of the single mom will be another huge factor, as a young and slim female who is generally attractive will definitely make it easier for you to perform well, contrary to a much older, chubbier and way less attractive one.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         OMG! Is that facial hair??

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If the single mom is very shy and humble, giving you more control over the situation, things will go smoother, contrary to a dominating and aggressive female with high expectations.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The better the chemistry, and the more comfortable you are with this person, the easier it will become in general to have sex together, and perform well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Because, and this is the really scary part, your <u>performance</u> will actually be important to her. Most females use that as a benchmark for how much you like her and the general quality of your relationship. Thus, a less performance from your part will only make her insecure. And if you fail completely, like not getting it up, it might actually become the end of that relationship.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This first barrier is the toughest one to get over. But as soon as you get over it, sexual relationships with adults will become increasingly easier to perform. And you <u>will</u> get used to it.

                         <br />
                         
                         If you should ever get caught off-guard in this regard, like the mom suddenly one evening gets all over you and wants to have sex with you, you <u>are</u> allowed to reject her with respect, and tell her that this is a little bit too soon for you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This is your best option if this happens while being totally unprepared for it, especially when being unsure about your ability to perform well or perform at all. It is <u>much</u> better to reject her, instead of trying to do it and then failing.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         All females handle such rejections differently. Some will be pleasantly surprised, and look at you as a very decent gentleman. Others will become insecure, or even hurt, as they expect all <u>males</u> to get all over them like horny dogs as soon as they give them the green light.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         So, when you're about to involve yourself into an adult relationship like this, to gain access to someone's children, it is usually best to <u>always</u> be prepared for adult sex. This will make such relationships go as smoothly as possible, with the most successful outcomes in the end.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         One way to go about this, as in always being prepared for adult sex, is to practice sexual abeyance, which you have already learned in the <a class="set3" href="urge_control.html#sexual_abeyance" target="_blank">urge control</a> chapter of this handbook.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If your body is sexually starved and your reproduction organs are all the time filled to the brink with semen, it will become much easier to perform well sexually with another adult.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can actually make you come too soon, which may seem like a failure, but really is a compliment towards most females if you think about it. Just tell her that this was so hot that you just couldn't help yourself. And then head for a second round while the cock is stiff, so <u>she</u> gets her satisfaction.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Such practice can make you so horny that it will <u>seem</u> like you're very much into the mom, even when you're not. This is utterly recommended if you got severe problems with adult sexual relationships, or are very unsure about it.

                         When you've known each other for a certain amount of time, and you all go well along together, especially after having proven your love for the single mom with a successfull consummation and some regular successful sex, moving in together and becoming a family will one day be expected.

                         However, there are some things you must be aware of:

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you move into <u>their</u> home, it will become much easier for you to leave them whenever you feel like it, especially if this new relationship turns out sour after a while.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is therefore recommended that you <u>keep</u> your own home for as long as possible, after having moved into their home, for the same reason as the latter.

                         But, this will also make them less depended on you, making it just as easy for them to kick you out at any time. This will make <u>your</u> situation pretty uncertain and vulnerable if you find yourself becoming dependent on them.

                         This option should therefore <u>only</u> be chosen if you aren't too sure about the relationship, or if you really want short-term relationships and be able to flee at any time.

                         If they move into <u>your</u> home, and especially if they are poor, they will end up becoming dependent on you; which will give you potential power and control over them, along with greater stability and predictability.

                         But, it will then become very hard for you to get rid of them if you want to end the relationship sometime in the future. Because, kicking them out on the streets isn't a pleasant thing to do and live with.

                         This option should therefore <u>only</u> be chosen if you are very sure about the relationship being positive and valuable, <u>while</u> preferring longterm relationships.

                         Well, if you don't have your own home yet, like being homeless or living with your parents, you won't have much choice in this regard; you'll just have to move into their home and become an important resource that they'll appreciate.

                         Moving in together and becoming a family is an important part of this method; because it will make you closer to her children, while she will increasingly trust you to finally be left alone with them under certain circumstances, like when she's at work, out shopping, sleeping, or partying with her friends.

                         Many pedophiles who choose this method to find and have sex with children, do the unfortunate mistake of giving the children too much attention and interest, while giving their moms very little to none; which is very understandable when you think about it, and an easy mistake to make even without thinking about it, which even professional pedophiles do.

                         When doing this mistake for a long enough time, the mom will eventually feel like being outside the relationship instead of inside it. And it may even cause pedophilic suspicions.

                         The common result of this mistake is that the pedophile looses that family at some point, as this will be hard to repair if it has gone out of control for too long.

                         So, <u>never</u> forget satisfying the mom as well, by giving her just as much attention and interest as her children, ideally 50/50. Use a calculator if necessary, so you give them a <u>similar</u> amount of hours of attention.

                         <u>Neither</u> forget to practice <u>romance</u> towards the mom, like regularly hugging and kissing her. Also buy her some flowers and chocolate now and then, like 2 times a month.

                         Regular sex is also important, while it is just as important that <u>you</u> take the initiative to sex just as much as she does. Don't make the common mistake of always waiting for <u>her</u> to take the initiative, as that may cause you to seem less interested in having sex with her, which is a bad thing to happen if you want to <u>stay</u> within that family.

                         Just keep on maintaining your <u>romantic</u> relationship like this.

                         If you succeed making them all <u>equally</u> happy, you should end up with a pretty nice family with some great access to children, which will last for years to come.
