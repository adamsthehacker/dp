                                   This chapter covers children in the ages between 0 and 3, being geared towards 1-2 year olds, which is the standard age preference for <b>nepiophiles</b>.

                         Babies and toddlers are some lovely little creatures, as if beautiful little dolls of porcelain have magically come into life. These children have the faces and bodies that are simply <u>made</u> to be smelled, tasted, eaten and rubbed all day long, being such soft, chubby and bouncy, and generally delicate.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These are also the easiest and most comfortable children for adults to practice sexual activities and intercourses with:
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you're having trouble braking that first barrier of having sex with children for the very first time, a child of this age group will <u>definitely</u> make that barrier very easy to break and cross.
                         
                         <br />

                         The initiation process is very easy with these young children. And general sex practice doesn't need that much of incremental steps, contrary to the older and much more complicated children. You can go straight for the cherry during your very first sex session; and do that <u>safely</u> without jeopardizing the child's nor your own wellbeing and security.

                         Neither are they all that picky towards penises, stickiness and wetness; neither being kissed on their faces and lips.

                         The first half of this age group is incapable of speaking well enough to reveal anything critical, which will make you sleep a whole lot better at nights as a practicing nepiophile.

                         This will also free you from any complex secrecy practice.

                         The second half of this age group will become increasingly better at speaking and revealing information, especially towards the end of it. But they will <u>still</u> have a limited mentality to understand things and express themselves <u>thoroughly</u>, which makes it possible to manipulate their speech.

                         If the speaking abilities of the older toddlers should become too frighting for a newbie, they usually have regular naps during daytime, which makes it possible to <u>safely</u> enjoy these sweet little dolls while they're sleeping.

                         With decent physical access to these little sugar bombs, you will be able to practice some very uncomplicated and interesting sex within a solid border of control and security.

                         Just make sure you exploit this innocence, sweetness and cuteness as much as possible before it disappears, as these little sweeties develop and grow up fast.

                         You <u>will</u> need special access to children of this age group, because these children are much protected and rarely left with any unrelated or unknown people for long enough times to complete any meaningful sexual activity.

                                   It is <u>highly</u> recommended to <u>not</u> have sex with babies under the age of 4 months, due to their early infancy fragility. My official recommended minimum age is therefore <b class="h">6 months</b>. This will however be all up to you, and it will be <u>your</u> responsibility solely. The younger the baby, the easier it can be harmed.

                                   Toddlers are beginning to develop speech towards the end of this stage, so special care has to be taken when interacting sexually with these children, as already explained within the <a class="set3" href="secrecy.html#toddlers" target="_blank">Security Guide</a>.

                                   If you're babysitting a child whom isn't yours, and you take off its diapers to access its delicious little genitals, some parents may notice that the diapers have been taken off while you've been watching the child. Parents tend to notice this easily, especially moms, because they have a certain way of strapping the diapers on. Unless of course, you are allowed to change them or the child poops.

                                   Toddlers can become some quite active and restless beings that can be difficult to hold still at one place for longer periods without them becoming grumpy with screaming and biting.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Sexual activities and intercourses with babies and toddlers should therefore happen at particular times of the day, and at particular places within their everyday environment:
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Exploit their nap times for sex practice; as right before they are scheduled for naps, which usually is right after a nice lunch, they will become quite tired and inactive. This makes them calm enough to more easily focus on their own sexual emotions and desires, which is why they have a tendency to masturbate themselves and enjoy sex during this time period.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   You may also exploit the nap <u>itself</u>, as in having sex with toddlers while they're sleeping. Most of them sleep quite deep and are hard to wake up, making them perfect for newbie nepiophiles as warm little sex dolls and sex toys.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   When the toddlers are in their highest activity state, you may exploit special places of your environment where they are used to stay still. You should therefore exploit their changing mats and feeding chairs for sexual activities.

                         It is very important that you know how this process works, as already <a class="set3" href="swk_prep.html#the_initiation_process" target="_blank">explained</a> in the latter preparation chapter.

                         Babies and young toddlers do rarely seduce other children and adults actively. Their egocentric sexuality is mostly directed towards themselves and their own genitalia, while additionally lacking the ability to feel romance and fall in love.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They mostly bond with adults due to an egoistic need for care and help, not because they got any true erotic motivations, contrary to the older children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is therefore rare to experience babies and toddlers acting seductively towards adults. They're simply too undeveloped, pure and innocent for that to happen.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         But they <u>do</u> got a very interesting property that you <u>may</u> look at as an act of seduction if you want to, being exploitable by nepiophiles to easily initiate a sexual relationship:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Babies and toddlers are <u>notorious</u> for exploring their own bodies and genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, if you are e.g. changing diapers on such a living doll on a changing mat, and it lies there and stares deeply into your eyes with its big and glossy eyes, while touching its private parts; well, if that's not a seduction and an open invitation to a sexual activity, then I don't know what is.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And such can happen anytime and anywhere with these dolls.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, this isn't really a seduction. It's more like two cars that accidentally crash in an intersection without any traffic lights: the tot decides to touch itself at the same time as a nepiophile stands in front of it, thus a crash is unavoidable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         It <u>still</u> is a passive seduction though!

                         Another interesting property with these children is that they totally lack any sexual morals or embarrassment, while being generally easy to initiate sexual relationships with.

                         Thus, it can become <u>very</u> easy to enter their sexual kingdom.

                                   Actually, recently I experienced something interesting with an approximately 2 year old girl during diaper change. She had only peed, so we did the change while she stood on her feet.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   As soon as the diaper came off, and her genitals came out in the open, she spontaneously pulled her vagina a part with her small fingers and said: "this is my pee-pee!", while looking seriously at me with her big blue eyes and long blond hair.
                                        
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                                             
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The reason for mentioning this occurrence is because it is a great example of a common passive seduction:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         She is curious about her vagina and wants to show it to me; she wants <u>me</u> to participate in her curiosity; she gives <u>me</u> the secret key to her magical sexual kingdom; and I can use that key to enter it if I want to. And so can <u>you</u>, if you ever experience anything similar. It also means that she trusts me, which is a great basis for a sexual initiation in the first place.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         And this isn't my first experience of such; neither is it a rare occurrence, in general, among those who got access to these beautiful and sexy little totties.
                         
                         <br />

                         I've also experienced several times that babies have gone for their genitals too. But without being able to speak much, they only touch themselves, and usually in a very flimsy way; which of course is just as much a passive seduction.

                         I will now teach you how to exploit such passive seductions in the most efficient and safe way for the both of you:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you are in a general room while a baby or toddler suddenly shifts its focus towards its own genitals, move towards the child and sit down beside it; unless you're already close to it.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If this happens during a regular service at a changing mat, just stop with whatever you're doing.

                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Wow! Look at <u>that</u>!"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                                             
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Don't make too much out of it, just comment the child's genitalia <u>without</u> naming it. And look at it in a way so that the child easily notices that you are <u>really</u> interested in it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child stares at you while doing this, as it may want to see if you approve this behavior or not, smile at the child in a kind and caring way. This will assure the child and motivate it to continue touching itself and seducing you indirectly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will already <u>now</u> sense a sexual tension enter the room, and this sensation will be especially powerful if you're a newbie nepiophile. This can actually turn into a very intense moment for even the most experienced nepiophiles out there. So, the temperature of the room will dramatically increase.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The younger children of this age group will more likely be occupied with their genitals in a more egoistic way, while the older children of this age group will more likely acknowledge and understand your <u>participation</u>, thus act more seductive.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is <u>regardless</u> an invitation into their sexual kingdom!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If this is the time and place for you to exploit this genital curiosity, to initiate a sexual relationship with the child, it is time to start <u>caressing</u> the child while it touches itself:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Start caressing the child, but <u>not</u> at its genitals at first. Gently caress the child's hair and head first, and its upper body. Eventually caress its lower legs. And keep on doing all this repeatedly for a little while, with lots of love and care put into it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will more likely arouse the child and turn it on additionally, making it even more motivated and acceptant towards genital fiddle and general sexual play with you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then move your caressing hands slowly towards its genitalia, and finally touch it as carefully and gently as you would have touched the nose of a sleeping lion in a dark and humid cave.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will quickly and easily notice if the child accepts any physical participation during this touching, which unfortunately some of the older children of this age group may not do if they don't know or trust you fully.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child starts to retract or seem uncomfortable when your hands are getting closer to its genitals, or simply rejects that, just move your hands slowly away from its genitals, while <u>continuing</u> caressing the child at non-private areas, as before.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child seems uncomfortable while touching it in general, retract your hands and just keep on looking at the child while it explores itself or shows off.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may make yet an attempt after a few minutes, <u>or</u> the next time this happens again.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just be calm and patient, while respecting the child's private space, and the child should <u>eventually</u> let you touch it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, try touching and fiddling with its <u>butt</u> instead, if it doesn't appreciate genital touching just yet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child accepts physical participation until the point of actually touching its genitalia, you may <u>then</u> engage a sexual activity with the child as described in the next sections.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, you <u>may</u> stop now if you want to, and instead perform sexual activities the next time this happens; which should happen quicker than ever before, since you have <u>already</u> created a sexual connection between the two of you.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This may be a vise decision to make anyway if you're new to this, and/or want to take things very slowly and carefully.

                         In some rare occasions, especially among the oldest children of this age group, they may show an interest in <u>your</u> genitals, either as well or instead, which becomes an active seduction.

                         <br />

                         This will depend on the kid's own sexual interest and drive, along with general access and privacy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A nice and easy trigger is first of all to increase the amount of diaper changes during a day, even when there's no pee or poop in it, while also increasing the <u>time</u> during each change.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Tickle the child some at non-genital areas while it lies there on the changing mat all nude; and give it lots of time and space to shift its focus towards its body and genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may additionally let the child play freely in nude or without diapers and panties on; and the more and longer, the better. This will mathematically increase the odds of the child switching its focus from general play towards genital play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It sometimes helps by letting the child play nude in a room where there's few to no toys or interesting things around, as that will additionally increase the odds of genital focus.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And of course, the less used the child is to play around nude, the more likely it will start focusing on its own genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         For children who're not potty trained, it would probably be wise to let them play around nude on floors with hard surfaces, which you can easily wipe clean of pee or poop if an accident should happen.

                         From there, it is just a matter of waiting; and then perform a <a class="set3" href="#passive_initiation" target="_blank">passive&#160;initiation</a> as soon as the child starts to focus on its own genitals, as described in the latter section above.

                         Professional nepiophiles do rarely suggest sexual activities to babies and toddlers in the traditional sense, as in asking them verbally, because these children have limited intellects not capable of understanding a concept of such.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Suggesting sexual activities to these children is therefore and instead done through a gradual <u>physical</u> seduction, to carefully see how far you can go before the baby or toddler becomes uncomfortable or starts to reject you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In other words, we're just doing it, with no questions asked. But we're doing it gently and incrementally, because we want to show respect and patience towards the child in question.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This means that you may just begin on the first sexual activity, as listed below, and see how far that takes you.

                         Most babies and toddlers who're in good moods will agree to such activities anyway, as long as they're treated nicely by an adult whom they like and trust.

                         Instead of just going straight for a sexual activity with a baby or toddler, especially toddlers, I always recommend a nice and arousing foreplay in advance, also known as grooming.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will first of all prepare the child, so it doesn't get all that shocked by a sudden and unexpected sexual seduction. Second, it will calm an otherwise active child down a bit, so it doesn't become too restless and grumpy during the activity. Third, it may even trigger some sexual arousal within the child, which will motivate the child to complete your sexual activity, hopefully with a nice and fulfilling orgasm at the end.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Find a nice and comfortable place to sit down at with the child on your lap, like in a comfy chair in a comfy living room.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, give the child a baby bottle with some nice tasting but sugarless lemonade or soda to drink from, or any other sugarless treat that the child appreciates. It's important that the treat is <u>sugarless</u>, because sugar is pure energy that will only make them more active and restless during the activity.

                         Just cuddle with the sweetie in a calm and gentle way:

                                   <li class="space">If it's a girl and you got some time, brush her hair in a caring and loving way. Why not style it so she'll look hot and slutty?</li>
                                   <li class="space">Whisper into its ear that you love it, repeatedly.</li>
                                   <li class="space">Generally, just hug and squeeze the child in a loving way.</li>

                         It's always wise to act calmly and slowly, as in slow motion, when interacting with such young children, as they will then end up as more calmer and less active themselves.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A successful grooming would be a calm child that obviously appreciates your special love towards it, thus being ready for a sexual activity. You may then lead the child to the place where the sexual activity is about to happen.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You should ideally use this grooming technique every time you're about to have sex with that child in the future. The child will then associate your sexual activities with treats and love, and learn that <u>this</u> is your way of suggesting it.

                         But they're also natural and common places where to regularly change dirty diapers and perform intimate care of children, being both familiar and safe places for most babies and tots, making them feel initially calm and comfortable in nude while being touched all over by various adults.

                         Anyone with regular access to a child on a changing mat, while being alone and private together, have got an unlimited access to a child's nude body and its genitals; at once.

                         Exploit the changing mat and its intimate care properties for seduction attempts, grooming and performing sexual activities with both babies and toddlers; especially if you're a concerned newbie who wants to carefully try seducing a sweet little baby or tottie for the very first time.

                         Also note that changing mats are some <u>really</u> great places to mix sexual activities with regular intimate care, so the children will have a hard time distinguishing between them; which also is a great way for newbies to explore baby and toddler sex.

                         With babies and toddlers, we will start by masturbating them, since these children will be more interested in their own genitals rather than yours. Then, we will move to <u>your</u> genitals and try making them explore and enjoy them. Finally, we will try performing an oral sexual intercourse with them, to consummate your relationship and make you become a little baby's or toddler's very first male, and ejaculate inside it.

                         I recommend starting with the first activity, and then move through all of them in the order listed above.

                         These are basic recommendations for sexual activities with babies and toddlers, all of which should be split into different sessions with at least one day between each one, so a child won't have to deal with too much sex at once.
                         
                         <br />

                         However, if you find yourself in a rare situation that can't be repeated that easily, you may execute all of these activities in just one session, but with the risk of overwhelming the child; the older the child, the higher the risk.

                                   Make sure that you're all alone and private during these sessions, and won't be disturbed nor surprised during them.

                                   Use a room that is familiar to the child, ideally its own bathroom on its regular changing mat, where it is used to be nude and receive intimate care and touching from adults.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Make sure the child has a very soft and comfortable surface to lie on during the whole session.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Increase the temperature of the room to above average, because being less clothed and nude can become freezing, thus uncomfortable and annoying for the child.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Undress them slowly and gently, while caressing them.

                                   Sex toys and vibrators may scare some toddlers, and is thus recommended to be avoided during the first sessions. But they're always welcome for later sessions, especially if the toddler can explore and play with them some before use.

                                   Keep an eye on the child's behavior during these activities, and see if it ever gets uncomfortable, which makes it wise to tone things down a bit, or even stop completely.

                                   The genitals of young children, especially little girls, can be pretty sensitive and thus easily hurt and become irritated when consistently rubbing and jerking them over longer periods.

                                   Such irritation can easily make their genitals and its surrounding area turn red afterwards, which later can attract negative attention from other intimate caretakers.

                                   Don't rub baby and toddler genitals too hard either, as this is a common mistake done by nepiophiles. They think that rubbing harder will make them feel better and come faster, but it won't.

                                   Avoid <u>any</u> sort of vaginal or anal penetration during these activities, as either requires a special technique that's reserved for another part of this handbook.

                         When you're about to masturbate a baby or toddler, it is always wise to start very carefully and try building up as much arousal as possible in advance.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Start by caressing its nude body all over, <u>except</u> for the genital area. Feel its feet and lower legs, its shoulders and arms, its chest and nipples, and it's tummy. Stroke gently.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Use a few minutes to gently massage and enjoy the child's nude and warm body with your hands. If the child is tired and calmed down during this warm-up, it will highly appreciate it and more likely become sexually aroused.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then start to feel and tickle its inner thighs in a teasing way. Make some funny sounds while doing it and give the child a funny look. Ask if it likes it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Remember that it is important to communicate as well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you're ready to go about the genital, begin by stroking it for a while with the backside of your fingers, upwards only. Do this as gently as possible, as in barely touching it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will tickle and tease the child's sexuality, in the same time as immediately reassuring the child that you <u>respect</u> the most sensitive and intimate area of its precious body.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With girls, put a little drop of creme or oil on the tip of your preferred finger, and start rubbing the clitoris very gently. Switch between circular and straight up-and-down rubbing, regularly, and keep your focus on the clitoris at first.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The advantage of using a small amount of lube and start by focusing on the clitoris only, is that you can then much easier see if they release any pussy juice during the masturbation, hence seeing if or when they get heavily aroused.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With boys, lube the tips of all your fingers, and just start jerking the boys penis <u>very</u> gently, but consistently. Try surrounding the little penis with your lubricated fingertips so it will feel like he is fucking a wet and delicious vagina.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The boy will get an erection if this becomes an arousing experience for him. And if that happens, you may gently squeeze his penis a little more while increasing the pace.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, both genders <u>may</u> become aroused and enjoy all this even <u>without</u> becoming wet or hard.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If or when a girl begins to release pussy juice, you may start to rub her whole vagina a little bit harder, without penetrating it in any way. You may eventually do this even if she doesn't release any natural juices, but then make sure you add more synthetic lube to make the whole vagina very slipper and comfortable for the girl to have rubbed some harder.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         While doing all this, the baby or toddler may want to use its own hands as well to touch itself. It's important to allow the child to touch its genitals just as much as you do, so make room for those small hands if they show up. And if necessary, especially when it comes to young babies, help the child by moving its hands <u>to</u> the genital area.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may actually want to teach and motivate the young child to masturbate itself regardless, as this can be important for the both of you in the future.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Also note that both girls and boys of this age group <u>highly</u> enjoy anal fiddle as well. Of course, without <u>any</u> penetration. You may rub it in the same way as rubbing the genital, ideally with some lube while rubbing them both simultaneously.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most healthy children who feel comfortable towards the adult, will enjoy masturbation when it's done correctly, as advised. This should become an <u>enormously</u> positive experience that the children would like to repeat anytime in the future.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is always very exciting for an adult to masturbate such young children, to see how they respond to it, and see if you're able to make them come with a great orgasm.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is enormously hot seeing such young children become aroused and horny, and hearing pleasures and moans from sweet and thin baby and toddler voices.                         
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Hopefully, you will give that sweet little baby doll of yours a nice orgasm, which would be a great way to end this activity.

                         <br />
                         
                         You may want to give the child oral sex as well, as in licking and sucking the child's genitals and anus, which will be very hot and delicious for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         I always recommend that you give the child oral sex after you have already masturbated it with your fingers. By starting with oral sex, you will not be fully able see how the child reacts to this <u>first</u> activity in the first place, which is important.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will obviously not need any creme or lube in advance, thus it would be best to wipe any existing grease off the child's intimate parts before you start.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's generally important that the genitals are fully clean in advance, especially the anus, or else you may get some nasty bacterias into your stomach that can make it upset or sick.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just use your mouth and tongue to taste the child and make it feel good. It may also trigger some laughter and fun too.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When giving female babies and toddlers oral sex, never stick your tongue <u>into</u> their vaginas, as this may cause discomfort and pain. Just lick it as you otherwise would carefully clean it, while focusing your attention on the clitoris.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child wants to use its hands as well as you're licking it, try making some room so you can lick both those cute little fingers and the genital in the same time.

                         <br />
                         
                         Also note that when you're licking and sucking their genitals, you can much easier masturbate yourself without the child noticing it. There's nothing like coming into your pants while having your mouth full with a baby's or toddler's sweet little vagina or penis for the very first time.

                         The babies and younger toddlers will more likely not hesitate exploring it with their small hands. The youngest ones may even try licking it or putting it into their mouths right away.

                         For the very youngest, you may carefully lead their cute little hands towards your penis, and try making them feel it.

                         The older children of this group will probably give you an evil smile and start biting their fingers in a slutty way, because this act will almost automatically trigger their instinctive and natural sexual curiosity, which will motivate them to explore it. Some tots will even become sexually aroused by just watching it.
                         
                         <br />

                         The latter may sound too good to be true, but this is <u>really</u> how the human brain is wired and how it works, and how many children have actually reacted in similar real-life occurrences.
                         
                         <br />

                         If the child keeps switching its eyes between your penis and your face, it shows a classical sign of being insecure, but not necessarily in a bad way; it usually means that the child just doesn't know what to do. And since you're the adult, a baby or toddler expects <u>you</u> to take charge and tell it what to do.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Use this opportunity to tell the child that Elmo can be touched and played with, and then see if the child wants to do that.

                         Some toddlers may become skeptical to your penis, as they have most likely never seen one before, but in the same time pretty curious and motivated to explore it. So, give them lots of time and space to eventually take that first step of touching and playing with an adult male penis, while their small hearts pound of excitement.

                                   If the child seems reluctant towards touching it, or in any way skeptical to this introduction in general, it would be a great idea to split this activity at this point, and continue from here another day and session.

                         When the initial study and exploration of the adult genital is done, it is time for your genitals to actually <u>meet</u> physically:

                         Start by lubing the child's genitals <u>and</u> your penis thoroughly, unless you're both already naturally lubed from arousal.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Pull back your foreskin and just start rubbing it gently onto the child's genitals, slowly forwards and backwards, whether being a female or male child.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         With female babies and toddlers, you can place your penis on their vaginas while they're lying on their back on e.g. a changing mat. Squeeze their thighs together so they surround your penis, and simply fuck their inner thighs and outer vagina.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you finally get the right technique for this action, it will become enormously delicious and hot for the both of you, and become pretty close to actually fucking the kid for real.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, many pedophiles use this technique as a safe alternative to fucking them for real.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may do the approximately same thing with the boys, except for showing a greater deal of carefulness so you don't squeeze their testicles by mistake. It would thus be wise to not close their thighs too hard together, but rather let your lubed genitals rub each other all over and all around.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Feel free to rub your penis on their anuses as well, while optionally using another hand to carefully fiddle with their genitals as already advised earlier; or wise versa.
                         
                         <br />

                         Just enjoy your nude and warm baby doll, while optionally rubbing your penis on other parts its body as well, after a certain time. But avoid rubbing your genitals over its face, as that should be reserved for the next activity and session.

                         <br />
                         
                         During the very first genital contact with babies and toddlers, an adult male ejaculation is very likely to happen, whether being on purpose or spontaneously and uncontrollably.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, it is important to do this in a certain way, so the child gets <u>gradually</u> used to adult ejaculations, and ends up with a positive experience after this activity is over.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A first-time ejaculation should therefore happen during the first part of this activity, during the introduction of your penis.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I recommend that you carefully masturbate yourself in front of the child, and I recommend that you control that ejaculation so that the child can comfortably see it from a safe distance without getting any semen onto itself. It can then study the ejaculation, and optionally study the semen itself afterwards.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         From there, you may carefully begin ejaculating onto the child's body, to see how it reacts to that.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may ejaculate a second time during this first session while your genitals meet, thus ejaculate carefully onto the child's genitals and/or tummy. Since you've already ejaculated once, it won't come that much of semen anyway.

                                   Some children of this age group can be very picky about unknown and sticky substances, aka semen, which should be respected by not ejaculating onto their bodies or clothes; as you want them to enjoy and be motivated to perform these activities in the first place. They usually become more acceptant and tolerant towards semen when they become more used to sexual activities in general, so just be patient.

                         This is the last and definitely hottest activity of them all, as it allows you to do something that is nothing less than utterly incredible: having a <u>fully</u> qualified sexual intercourse with a baby or toddler, by penetrating it with your male genital and ejaculating inside it, without any penetration training needed.

                         <br />
                         
                         However, it is also the most complicated activity of them all, which actually don't work on several babies and toddlers.
                         
                         <br />

                         You will just have to try this special activity out on a little doll of yours and see how it goes, especially on the mid to latter stage of this age group, and the children with those large and sexy mouths that should handle an adult male pretty well.

                         I always recommend that a baby or tot experiences its first oral intercourse with an adult male <u>after</u> having already completed the latter two activities with complete success, also including semen ejaculations. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will make it accumulated with sexual play, adult penises, and semen ejaculations, <u>before</u> getting an adult male inside itself for the first time, which will highly increase the likelihood of first-time success.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I also recommend combining this activity with masturbation, as that may make the child sexually aroused, so it becomes less afraid of and more motivated to get an adult male far into its mouth; even accept and swallow a large load of cum.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This activity <u>may</u> be practiced as the very first sexual activity, and even without masturbating the child into arousal first. However, this will more likely lead to complications, like being rejected when trying it, and bitten when forcing it.

                                   Children <u>love</u> approvals and compliments from adults whom they trust and respect, so don't forget making them feel skillful and special as soon as they start to lick your penis or let it inside their red little mouths.

                                   Perform the first oral intercourse <u>very</u> incrementally; and try finding the child's threshold, like when it starts to gag or seem uncomfortable. When a threshold is established, you may fuck the child's mouth consistently, but not too fast <u>nor</u> too hard.

                                   You can safely ejaculate into a baby or young toddlers mouth, as these children haven't yet reached the yucky stage of the preschoolers and older. But late toddlers may not appreciate the bitter taste and sticky substance of semen, which may cause them to dislike it, and all similar activities in the future.

                                   Whenever you're unsure, and especially when the child is a close and longterm lover of yours, ejaculate outside the child's mouth and avoid hitting its face with semen. You may of course try ejaculating into the child's mouth during future sessions, after some further practice and experimentations.

                         Have the child lying down on its back in front of you, rotated 90 degrees to the left, while ideally being nude. Make sure that its head and your penis are at the same height, and have your penis in front of it with about 1 foot of distance.
                         
                         <br />

                         It's head should now be conveniently in front of your penis while its genitals should be easily reachable with your right hand; a very nice position for this activity, for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may have the child in the opposite direction, if you prefer using the opposite hand.

                         Use your right hand to gently masturbate the child, and use your left hand to simultaneously caress its face while gently and slowly rubbing its lips with your thumb.

                         Children are quite orally aggressive at this stage when being sexually aroused, so they may start licking or sucking on your thumb when rubbing their lips, which would indicate that they're both ready and motivated for an oral intercourse.

                         Babies and toddlers don't need to be aroused through masturbation before attempting to penetrate them orally. You're free to just try it whenever you feel like and when it is appropriate to do so, just to see how far it goes.

                         If you're not combining the child's first oral intercourse with masturbation, it doesn't matter what position it's in, or if it's clothed or unclothed, as long as it seems to feel safe and comfortable having your penis a foot or so in front of its face.

                         These are the general instructions, <u>regardless</u> of combining this activity with masturbation or not:
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you're not already doing it, start caressing its hair and face with your hand while carefully rubbing it lips with your thumb.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When ready, <u>slowly</u> approach its face with your penis.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child either don't face your penis <u>or</u> turns its face away when it approaches, don't use your hand or any verbal commands to force the child to face it. Just let the penis gently and barely touch its cheeks, while keeping on stroking its face with your hand in a loving way. Try rubbing your penis head over the child's face or lips without annoying it too much, and make your penis cuddle with the child's cute face, as this might gradually motivate it to finally start sucking you.

                         If it seems totally uncomfortable by having your penis coming closer to its face, move it back and away from its face again, while keeping on caressing its head and lips. And make a few more attempts, as slowly and gently as possible.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may have to end the session, and then retry it another day, if this total unwillingness continues for several minutes; which is more likely to happen with the older toddlers.
                         
                         <br />

                         After a little while of having your penis cuddling with the child's face, the child might turn its head towards it all by itself. You may optionally try moving its head towards it in a gentle and motivating way, while still caressing its face and head.

                         When the child finally faces your penis with its small red lips, and you're ready to try penetrating it for the first time and become its first male, keep on caressing its face while slowly and gently pushing your penis head towards its lips.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If the child is old enough to understand it, you may gently and kindly suggest opening its mouth.
                         
                         <br />

                         As soon as the mouth opens, push your penis head only halfway inside it, and then out again. And keep on repeating this for a half minute or so.
                         
                         <br />

                         If the child seems to accept it, start moving your penis some further inside, like your whole penis head, by using the same technique; and do that for another half minute or so.

                         The child's head should rest, either on a surface or within your hands, while <u>you</u> control the penis in and out of its mouth by moving your hips.
                         
                         <br />

                         And you're now actually <u>fucking</u> a little baby or toddler!

                         Just keep on fucking that sweet little brat of yours, slowly and repeatedly, in and out, as long as it accepts what's happening and seems comfortable enough to <u>complete</u> the intercourse.

                         If you are masturbating the child, or are simultaneously performing any other sexual activity that makes the little baby or toddler aroused, use the arousal to your advantage:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Wait with entering the child's mouth until it becomes sexually aroused; it will then be way more acceptant and tolerant towards an oral penetration of a large and wet adult male.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also be less incremental when moving inside it, and be a little more rougher when the real intercourse begins.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Try avoiding the child from getting an orgasm while it sucks you, and try to trigger one when you feel an ejaculation is coming and you want to come into its mouth.
                                                            
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will almost be like operating a machine, which all-in-all requires a lot of practice, including learning the child's sexuality better to know, so you can time things well and make this activity work in the best way possible for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The ideal thing to happen is that you come inside its mouth either when it is very close to an orgasm or in the middle of one. Most children will then suck you as deep as an old well, and swallow anything you give them orally, without hesitating, while enjoying it enormously.
                         
                         <br />

                         It will be additionally arousing for the child to suck on something wet and large with its mouth when being aroused, as the human mouth <u>is</u> after all an erogenous zone.

                         This is a well-used technique among professional child lovers to make children <u>very</u> motivated to suck you. Because, they will <u>want</u> to be sexually stimulated, but that can only happen if they suck your cock deeply and swallow all your semen.
                         
                         <br />

                         This can become a torturous experience for the children, but not in any painful way. It will be pure torture of pure sexual lust, with an unmatched relief for the both of you at the end.

                         Some children have actually ended up crying out loudly of pure horniness during such sessions, and shivering for an hour or so after it has been successfully completed.

                         Though, this technique does <u>only</u> work on aroused children, and especially on children with strong libidos who get very horny very easily, and being capable of getting hard orgasms.

                         Tie the child's hands, either to the bed poles or behind its back, so it can't reach its own genitals. But make sure to tie them in a comfortable way, and only if she or he agrees to it.
                         
                         <br />

                         As soon as the child becomes sexually aroused, move your penis towards its face. Then <u>stop</u> the masturbation as soon as your penis makes contact with the child's face in one way or another, and <u>only</u> continue masturbating the child when it licks or sucks your penis in a way that pleases you in an acceptable way. Stop once again as soon as it spits it out.

                         If the child is old enough, you may optionally tell the child to open its mouth and suck your genital, and that you will only continue touching its genitals when it sucks you nicely.

                         <br />
                         
                         Regardless of which, the child should eventually realize that sucking your cock is the <u>only</u> way to feel good and get that nice orgasm at the end.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you manage to <u>really</u> arouse the child, the child will eventually become CRAAAZY motivated to suck your cock. Because, you will refuse the child an orgasm until you have ejaculated inside its mouth. And this can take some time, which can cause a lot of sexual torture for the child.

                         And as soon as it has swallowed every single drop of your cum, and licked your penis and balls all clean, you can give the little sweetie its long overdue orgasm.

                         When these activities end, give the child some more treats, like some chocolate or ice cream.

                         This will make the child associate these special activities with very nice treats at the end of each session, which will further motivate it to repeat them soon.

                         This section will go through the most popular sex activities with babies and tots that aren't based on sexual initiations, thus they can be immediately performed on any child at anywhere.

                         These activities are <u>initially</u> very light, and thus very safe and comfortable to perform for those of you who aren't yet ready for true initiations of true sexual relationships with children. This allows you to use way more discreet and careful ways to experience sex with children if you're having difficulties braking that first barrier. And they're highly adjustable as well, so <u>you</u> can decide the strength and length of these activities.

                         If you're one of those who want to start out in a very easy way, while doing something that's very funny and enjoyable for the both of you, something that true nepiophiles will probably enjoy the most, I will start out with a very neat activity to easily French Kiss babies and toddlers.

                         Babies and toddlers may initially not look at French Kissing as any interesting, some may even not like it. So this activity will be performed in a neat way to teach <u>and</u> make small children <u>enjoy</u> kissing adults in the most delicious ways.

                         As already stated, this isn't a sexual activity. But it <u>is</u> a very funny and hot activity that may work as a barrier breaker for the most skeptical nepiophiles out there, who really want to have sex with (their own) children, but haven't yet dared to.

                         This is also totally legal to do, unless you cant resist jerking yourself off while doing it, which actually is quite easy and safe to do nevertheless.

                                   This should ideally be practiced when the child is quite hungry, like at the times when regular feeding is scheduled.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   If possible, you may want to skip a meal in advance, so the kid gets extraordinary hungry before this activity. This is fully safe to do, as long as the child drinks a lot in the meanwhile.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Either <u>make</u> cream yourself or buy it on a spray box. It has to be puffy and non-fluid, like the cream you would have on e.g. the top of a birthday cake.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   For the youngest children of this group, any sort of suitable baby food or desert is a great alternative.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   You can choose to either strap the child into a feeding chair <u>or</u> have it on your lap facing towards you; I guess depending on the child's age and your tolerance for mess.
                                        
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as the kid sees the cream, it should become very motivated to eat it, especially the toddlers who understand what it is and how sweet it is.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         So, the <u>way</u> you feed them will be less important to them, as long as they get it into their sugar hungry mouths.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All you need to do is to add some of this cream at the end of your tongue, like sand on a shovel, and feed them creme.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A lot of interesting things can happen. The child may just open its mouth so you can stick your tongue into it, or it may start to lick and suck on it. Whatever happens, you <u>will</u> be French kissing the child. And it <u>will</u> be hot.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When the child gets the cream into its mouth, add some more on your tongue, and just continue enjoying the child's sugar mouth while it conveniently allows you to.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Don't put too much creme onto your tongue at a time; by feeding the child with small dozes, you can keep on doing this for ages.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Masturbate yourself (under the table) if you want to. But try hiding it from the child as much as possible, and be aware of anyone whom might enter the room or area, while enjoying both the child's sweet mouth and yourself in the same time.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Though, if you're all new and quite skeptical to such erotic activities with children, you may want to wait with masturbation until you feel more comfortable with all this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now you've introduced a special activity to the child that it will most likely enjoy doing. And this can be repeated as much as you want to into the unseeing future.
                         
                         <br />

                         Kissing is an important part of child love, and this is a nice way to do it with babies and toddlers. These children will highly enjoy it, since it involves sweets and fat creme.

                         Lap humping is yet another old trick in the book of pedophilia, especially among nepiophiles who want to experience sex with children in the most discreet and legal ways.
                         
                         <br />

                         The younger the children used for lap humping, the less likely they will understand what's happening. This age group is therefore an outstanding age group for some serious and intense lap humping, while being very secure to perform.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Lap humping is an enjoyable experience for most children as well as the adults performing it, as it will give the children a sensation of being extraordinary loved and cared for in a very intimate and intense way.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Lap humping is also a sexual activity that stays within a gray zone legally wise, as you'll have all your clothes on while actually not touching each other's genitalia. Thus, it will be <u>really</u> hard to prove any sexual molestation in court, even with much older children, unless you're videotaped closeup in HD.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It can also be practiced with a child while other adults aren't far away, and in situations when they might suddenly appear. Since you're both dressed up and just having a nice lap time, you may stop instantly if an adult appears or passes by, and continue when the coast is clear again.
                         
                         <br />

                         This activity has therefore been done by nepiophiles in homes full of people, public parks, and even daycare facilities, among several. It can <u>really</u> be hidden.

                         It will give you a very nice sexual experience and final relief, while staying <u>very</u> comfortable and safe as a true child lover. This is thus a very common way for nepiophiles to experience sex with the younger children, toddlers especially.

                                   Have a condom strapped onto your penis in advance, so you don't make a mess in your pants. Many nepiophile daycare workers have condoms on when they're at work, just in case.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Pull back the foreskin of your penis before strapping on the condom, to make it more sensitive to friction. Optionally, put some e.g. small marbles into the condom and underneath your penis head, to further add friction during the humping.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                                       
                                   If you're not all alone and private during this activity, or the child is at the end of this age group, use jeans while doing this. Jeans will much easier camouflage an erected penis, so others won't see it and the child won't sense it that easily.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   However, if you <u>are</u> all alone and private during the session, and the child is very young and less observant, using sweatpants without underpants will make the friction better, and the general sensation greater.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Your erection will be very hard to hide in sweatpants, especially without any underpants on. So, you may do this on older children if you <u>intentionally</u> want them to notice that bump and get curios about it.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Perform this activity close the the child's scheduled nap time, as it will then become very tired and calm on your lap, giving you <u>lots</u> of time to enjoy it and get a nice ejaculation in your pants. The utterly concerned newbies may want to have the child fall in sleep on their laps first, especially the very first time.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   If the child isn't tired, have several picture books to look at. And picture books <u>only</u>, as it will be hard to read anything while humping the sweetie.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Find a nice place to sit for this activity, like in a nice couch.

                         This activity is all about having a child on your lap while you're masturbating yourself in hide, ideally with no hands.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         One way to do this is to have the child sit with its butt right on your penis, and then waggle the child carefully so you kind of rub your genitals onto the child's butt, through your clothes.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Another technique is to waggle your legs sideways, so your penis gets regularly squashed between your inner thighs when your knees meet during the waggle. However, this technique requires some practice in advance to master fully.
                         
                         <br />

                         A few people are able to get no-touch ejaculations, which means that you can think yourself into an ejaculation, especially with help from being very close and intimate with a child while smelling and kissing it. However, this technique requires some serious practice and concentration, <u>and</u> time. It will also require that you're already super horny. The downside with this method is that you'll get crazy aroused, which will cause a lot of moaning, breathing, twitching and shivering from your part, making it too easy scaring the child. But these ejaculations are the hottest there are.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, you may also just touch yourself. And the best way to do this is to have a hole in your pocket so you can put your hand into it and easily access your genitals. You can then masturbate yourself in a more traditional way, while still being able to do it pretty discreetly. Just move the child over to one of your thighs, so you can easily access your genitals.
                         
                         <br />

                         Regardless of which, this will eventually and hopefully end in a nice and warm ejaculation into your pants, <u>while</u> having your favorite child on your lap and preferably being tight and intimate; smelling it, kissing it, and cuddling close together.

                         Just start out with this activity in an easy way, and practice it with either several or a certain child, and just see what happens. Try experimenting with different techniques and your own customizations, so you will finally be able to exploit this very nice activity fully; and do it a lot.

                         A couple of daycare workers whom I know do this regularly almost each and everyday, with special techniques and customizations that they have developed over many years.

                         This activity is one of the few that allows you to have a sexual intercourse with a child, without the child being aware of it.

                         It is yet another much used activity among nepiophiles who want to take things as far as possible, while still staying as safe as possible; especially when dealing with mature toddlers who speak a lot.

                         There will be some basic similarities to the previous Tongue Feeding activity, making this a very common next-step for the tongue feeders, and a big leap into baby and toddler sex.
                         
                         <br />

                         However, the success of this activity do vary some, depending on the child's tolerance for such activities and how much it trusts you. Thus being gentle, careful and incremental is very important now, in addition to knowing the child well.

                                   A rope is needed for the older children of this age group, or ideally handcuffs that fits children; toy handcuffs for kids may be sufficient for this age group.

                                   A blindfold is needed for the toddlers. Sleeping blindfolds are <u>highly</u> recommended, as they are the most efficient and safe to use if you don't want the child to see what's really happening through cracks and openings. You may want to add some facial cotton pads over their closed eyes before putting the blindfold on, as that really blinds them <u>while</u> feeling comfortable.

                                   A large towel is highly recommended to put onto the child during this activity, as it can become pretty messy with lots of <u>different</u> substances being poured over it.

                                   Concentrated and semi-liquid caramel sauce is recommended as the main flavor and suck motivator; but it can be of any other taste, like e.g. strawberries. Being strong in taste and thick in substance is important, as you'll only be using small drops of the liquid over a longer duration.

                                   Regarding the older children of this group, and those who're able to speak to a certain extent, it is important to make this activity a special game, <u>and</u> make the children <u>agree</u> to playing it in advance. Or else, they might freak out when being handcuffed and blindfolded, making their mouths both challenging and dangerous to enter. You may call it "the&#160;caramel&#160;game", and say that it involves eating candy.

                                   Have your zipper already pulled down, as the older children of this group may recognize that sound, and thus understand what's happening. Ideally, use sweatpants without a zipper.

                                   Keep an eye on the child's behavior during these activities, and see if it ever gets uncomfortable, which makes it wise to tone things down a bit, or even stop completely.

                         Make the child sit in its regular feeding chair. You may want to strap the younger children of this age group, whom should already have strapping chairs.

                         If the child is too young to speak, or generally don't speak well, ties and blindfolds aren't strictly needed. The youngest children will probably not appreciate that equipment anyway.

                         If the child is old enough to speak well and understand things, ties and blindfolds are obviously recommended to use as a part of the game, as you don't want the child to see and understand what's really happening.

                         However, the use of ties and blindfolds are totally optional and all up to you.

                         If using ties and blindfolds, tie the child's hands behind its back, but make sure that the child sits comfortable and that its hands doesn't hurt while being tied up; you want this activity to last as long as possible. And make sure that the blindfold is <u>really</u> blinding the child, as an improper blinding can make the child see what's really going on through the sides of its nose. Make sure that the blindfold also fits and sits well, so it doesn't fall off during the activity.

                         When everything has been set up correctly, let the beast out and pull its foreskin all the way back.

                         Put a couple of drops of caramel sauce onto the tip of your penis head, and smear it around the tip.
                         
                         <br />

                         Tell the child that the caramel is on its way now, so it can open its mouth some. And then just let the tip of your cock head meet the child's beautiful red lips.

                         Try as much as possible letting the <u>child</u> decide how to taste it and eat the sauce.

                         Since most children can't get enough of sweets, it will most likely enjoy doing this. And so will you(!).
                         
                         <br />

                         After a little while, you may try experimenting some by adding more sauce to your penis head, and getting it further inside. You may also add some sauce to your penis <u>while</u> the child is licking and sucking it, to keep it longer inside its mouth.
                         
                         <br />

                         Any precum that comes out will be camouflaged by the concentrated caramel sauce flavor. And if you finally ejaculate inside the child's mouth, or around its face, it will most likely think that it's some sort of food, and thus enjoy eating it.
                         
                         <br />

                         Right after an ejaculation, add a large portion of caramel sauce onto your penis, and let the child suck it some more.
                         
                         <br />

                         And it can't get any better than this, really; having a beautiful child lick and suck your cock until you come hard into its wet mouth, and it swallows and eats your cum while enjoying it.
                    
                         <br />

                         And if that wasn't enough, the child won't be able to understand what's really happening; unless you want it to.

                         This is why this activity is exceptionally popular among nepiophile and pedophile daddies, grandpas, uncles and daycare workers, among some.
