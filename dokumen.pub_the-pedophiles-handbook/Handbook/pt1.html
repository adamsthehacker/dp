                         It doesn't matter what solar system you visit, in whatever galaxy; even if you check out every square inch of the whole universe, the hottest thing that has ever been in existence can only be found in the humble Milky Way, on the humble planet Earth; which is pushing your erected penis into the vagina or rectum of a cute and innocent toddler or child, being the tightest thing you can ever squeeze yourself into, in the same time as being so soft, wet, bouncy and elastic.

                         Our main goal with this chapter and guide, is to make all children able to finally and successfully fuck adult males <u>without</u> experiencing any significant pain nor discomfort, and make them able to <u>enjoy</u> vaginal and anal sexual intercourses, whether they're toddlers, preschoolers, elementary schoolers, adolescents or late teenagers.

                         You will basically be taught how to fuck children; whom <u>can</u> be successfully and harmlessly fucked, from a very early age, when being correctly and properly trained.

                         This chapter and guide isn't among the largest ones, luckily because penetration training of children isn't all that complicated nor difficult as many newbies think. It is actually very easy and straight forward to practice initially, but still requires at least <u>some</u> critical advices and instructions, as there's a fine line between success and failure when training and fucking children, and young children especially. And <u>failure</u> in this regard, can mean anything from a doctor's visit to actually the death of a child.

                         Before we can go about the penetration training, there are some important preparation to go through first:

                         The first subject we'll look into in this guide, is how the child's age affects penetration training.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         For instance, several have asked me what the earliest age a pedophile may start the penetration training at:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When it comes to little girls and vagina training, they shouldn't be too young and neither too old. Because, too young girls can be harmed, while the mature girls won't need any training.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The same goes for anal training, except for this not having any upper limit; because the anal should <u>ideally</u> be trained before any first-time intercourse, regardless of age. However, it isn't <u>strictly</u> needed for adolescents, especially not teens, but recommended nevertheless to avoid pain, tearing and medical complications.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Let's take a deeper look into each age group:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="babies_and_toddlers"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">Babies and Toddlers</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The vaginas of baby girls go through some physical changes after birth and during the next months, being very swollen, sensitive and fragile. Most of these changes stop however when the child becomes about 1 year old; and from there it stays mostly unchanged until puberty, except for growing bigger, along with the rest of the child's body, of course.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         My personal recommendation for the earliest possible penetration training is therefore 1 year of age, which also include anal training. This is a nice safety rule to follow.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And the earlier you start after this age, the more <u>groundwork</u> will be completed before the child gets to an age where training becomes otherwise challenging and difficult. You will also be finally able to fuck the sweetie at a <u>very</u> young age, like when she's 3, which can become a quite epic experience.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                                           
                         Most children also lack memories before the age of 4, meaning that the challenging beginning of all penetration training, which often involves at least <u>some</u> pain and crying, will be over and done with as the child becomes more consciously aware and starts remembering things; almost like 'waking up' at the age of 3 or 4, with a big little vagina or bum, which it can use to ride daddy or uncle far into the kingdom of kiddie sex, while riding herself into orgasm after orgasm.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Another part of this groundwork is to tear away that annoying hymen on the little girls, <u>before</u> they start remembering things, thus giving them the possibility to enjoy pain-free and generally problem-free intercourses when they get older.

                                   A <u>huge</u> drawback regarding vaginal training of babies and tots, is that they're usually very supervised and inspected.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Their diapers are being regularly changed by other adults, which usually means brief inspections of their genitals, like looking out for tenderness and rashes during cleaning.                    
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Moms know their baby and toddler girls well, and may thus one day notice that the hymen is suddenly gone, along with some redness around the vagina area, which <u>will</u> alert most mommies.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Most of these children are also being regularly checked by pediatricians at health care centers, which <u>may</u> include brief and routine inspections of their genitals, which is normal.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   And, most moms who see a change in their little sweeties vaginas, will usually give their pediatricians a visit, as in ASAP.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Thus, any vaginal training may be <u>revealed</u> through either, especially by a serious and thorough pediatrician.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   And, most pediatricians <u>will</u> report the most suspect cases to the police and child protection services, which will open the gates to hell and let the demons out.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   It's important to just think about this and be aware of it when you start the training, and thus be as careful and patient as possible while doing it, so the child doesn't get any apparent rifts or cracks in that very forbidden area.

                                   And then tell her that it must have a natural cause, like it may have been broken during any cleaning of the vagina, or when the child has been playing actively or fallen on its crotch.

Then tell her that as long as the vagina isn't red, and doesn't bleed, there should be nothing to worry about.

                                   Optionally, wait with any training until the child begins to use the potty or toilet, and is no longer using a diaper. But <u>still</u> be careful, so you'll stay underneath the pediatrician's radar.

                         One nice thing about regular children from the age of 4 and older, is that most of them are already quite sexually active; while most early elementary schoolers have <u>already</u> started experimenting with vaginal penetrations, <u>all</u> by themselves.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Their genitals have also become a lot more private by now, and not that supervised nor inspected. This will give you way more privacy and security regarding vaginal training.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, this is also the age when the girls hymens are especially sensitive, making any vaginal penetration training quite challenging; unless the child is <u>really</u> horny and into it, and can take some pain without freaking out too much.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Some of these children will therefore and unfortunately say <u>no</u> because of this, and not consent to it anytime soon.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Luckily, their rectums are far less sensitive at this age, making anal training way easier to perform and a great alternate hole to train and slide yourself into instead, if vaginal training fails.

                         <br />
                         
                         The child will have to feel <u>especially</u> comfortable and safe towards you as a person for <u>any</u> training to become practical, successful and secretive. Closeness, intimacy and trust, and ideally strong dependence, will thus be important factors.

                         The boys are usually some rougher than the girls, and are therefore considered as easier to train at the early part of this stage, according to feedback from lots of boy lovers.

                                   There's a fair amount of children girls within this age group who accidentally hurt their genitals during play and activities, causing them to bleed and freak out mommy; which usually leads to a pediatrician or gynecologist, who easily can see if mommie's princess has been trained or fucked lately.

                         These children will generally handle penetration training much better than the latter. You can much better communicate with them and walk them through the training process, while the girls hymens will be generally less sensitive.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most girls who are close to their adolescence will additionally be very interested in and motivated for vaginal penetration, as they think a lot about that as they get close to puberty.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Both girls and boys will highly appreciate anal stimulation too, which also makes anal training easier than ever before.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I would say that this is probably the easiest and safest group of children to train, but also the most challenging to initiate sexual activities with. But if you <u>do</u> manage to initiate a sexual relationship with a late elementary schooler, any penetration training should be highly enjoyable, convenient and safe.
                         
                         <br />

                         And finally, the training process itself will be much shorter and go generally much smoother than any of the younger children, obviously because their vaginas and rectums will be larger. Some of these kids will even handle a full penetration and fuck during the very first training session.

                         Seriously spoken, there are a few important differences here that you may want to take into consideration:

                         Even though the vagina has been made for penetrations, it still has a membrane in front of it that creates a kind of barrier; also known as the hymen. This can cause problems and pain, and sometimes make it totally impossible to penetrate at all.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will learn more about the hymen later in this guide.

                         <br />
                         
                         The rectum lack this barrier, and has 'content' flowing through it on a regular basis, making it way easier and more convenient to penetrate and train.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The vaginas of little girls are also like forensic magnets: as soon as you start training baby and toddler girls, observant moms can easily see any changes to their vaginas, especially sudden unsealed labias and hymen breakages. Doctors and specialist can easily see and prove most vaginal penetrations regardless of the child's age and the time since the last penetration; while most vaginas can store dried up semen residues for very long times, which means storing your DNA.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Not to mention, vaginas are more prone to smelly infections with discharges; which also function as giveaways, and sometimes causes mommy to make a doctor's appointment out of fear for her child's health, suspicions, or even both.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But the latter doesn't apply to the much more sealed bum; which is rarely inspected during intimate care, and is being 'cleaned' from any semen residues when the child poops.

                         However, when it comes to adolescents, <u>their</u> vaginas are the best and most convenient choice for a painless and generally successful first-time penetration.

                         There are also differences between the vagina and rectum when it comes to the pure sensation of sexual intercourses:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The vagina has a natural shape that is designed to perfectly fit male penises of various sizes, while offering natural lubricants and many small skin folds to really stimulate the penis during the intercourse; all of which make it the most delicious hole for a male to penetrate. While of course, a child's vagina will be generally tighter than any adult vagina, due to the obvious fact that children are smaller, making them even hotter to fuck.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The vagina is also the hole that most girls will be naturally and instinctively motivated to have penetrated during sexual arousal, making most girls enjoy <u>such</u> penetrations the most.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The rectum is very smooth inside, with a very tight and somehow short muscle ring. So, the tightness is mostly concentrated around that muscle ring, making it less evenly tight than a vagina. This creates a somehow less delicious experience for a male inserter in pure physical terms.

                         The rectum is also a hole that doesn't naturally and instinctively motivate for penetration among the girls, causing a greater fear of pain, which again <u>causes</u> more pain.

                         However, and to the rectum's defense, anal sex tends to cause much more intense and longer orgasms among both females and males, whether you masturbate them or not, due the physical stimulations of the internal genitals. And since an adult male's penis is very large compared to a child's bum, the sensation of both tightness and hard orgasms will only become stronger for both parties.

                         The bottom line is that young children vaginas are initially more complicated to train than rectums, while much easier revealing foul play to other third-parties. But they do offer the most delicious fucks for both parties, and is the best choice for successful first-time penetrations of adolescents.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The rectum is thus far less complicated to train, while being very good at hiding any foul play from other third-parties; and it can offer some really extreme orgasms for the inserted ones when the right techniques are found and used. But it <u>will</u> be a less sexual experience for both parties as a whole, and be way more painful, especially for first-time penetrations of adolescents.

                         It sure isn't easy to pick the right hole, as it really isn't a <u>right</u> one to choose. One of them <u>has</u> to be picked though, if you want to make love to a child in the traditional sense. And that hole <u>has</u> to be <u>your</u> decision, based on your own situation and comfort level.

                         Gay sexual child lovers, who only wants to fuck boys, will obviously not have the luxury of choosing between the vagina and rectum. But don't worry, because the rectum <u>is</u> nevertheless a very special and delicious hole to fuck, and can be safely trained and fucked at very young ages, if it's done correctly and properly.

                         We're getting closer and closer to the penetration training, and the next stop along the way is the subject of <b class="h">lubricants</b>, which will be the most important part of the whole training.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I've often been asked about what is the best lube to use when training and fucking children. So, I will now explain what I think is best to use, and why I think that:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If we start with <b class="h">oils</b>, their main advantage is their super slipperiness, which causes things to glide very easily while causing very little friction. The disadvantage with oils is that they can become <u>too</u> slipper for sexual intercourses, making the friction so little that it might become hard to feel <u>anything</u> at all, thus not get the sensation of fucking, while of course slipping easily out of a young child's shallow vagina or bum.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         The <b class="h">cremes</b> are the opposite of oils: not that slipper, while causing a lot more friction. Thus cremes give you a much greater sensation of penetration and fucking, but more friction does also mean more pain in certain circumstances.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These are the exact same reasons for why we use oils in car engines, and not creme. And the same reasons for why I recommend using <b class="h">oils</b> when practicing penetration training with children, as this <u>has</u> too be as slipper as possible to expand their vaginas and rectums efficiently, <u>without</u> causing too much pain nor any damages during the process.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And of course, it is just as important to choose oils that are <u>especially</u> designed and tuned for vaginal or anal sexual intercourses. These oils can be bought at any sex shop.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         By using your own custom oils, like baby oils, mineral oils, cooking oils, and etc, you may mess up a vagina's PH level, causing irritations and infections; and even make some condoms dissolve and crack, making adolescents pregnant and generally leaving lots of evidence inside a youngster.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When the child has become trained however, you may want to switch to <b class="h">creme</b> to get a better fucking sensation, and much easier stay within the kid when fucking little her or him.

                         Penetration training will obviously require some equipment. But the nice thing about this equipment, is that you most likely have most of it somewhere around your home already.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All you need is a set of phallic shaped objects of various sizes, aka <b class="h">dildos</b>, ranging from the narrower to the wider.

                         <br />
                         
                         They should ideally be all smooth during the training, and not too soft. This smoothness will make it especially comfortable for the child to be expanded, while the smoothness will be kind to the vagina and anal tissue, as in not creating any unnecessary rifts internally. Harder equipment will work better as expanders, because they won't be elastic.

                         <br />
                         
                         The most used penetration training kit is a set of screwdrivers in various sizes, as in using their <u>handles</u> as dildos. 
                                                            
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just make sure that the screwdriver handles are as smooth as possible, at least not having any sharp patterns nor edges.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Search patiently through your home and online stores for such equipment, which will be very innocent equipment to buy, own and have lying around, thus not attract any negative attention nor suspicions towards yourself.
                         
                         <br />

                         I know it may sound harsh and disrespecting to use the handles of hardware tools for this training; but it really doesn't matter what you use, as it doesn't make any real difference for the child nor its exciting penetration training.

                         Of course, the very best equipment that you <u>can</u> use is appropriate and official sex toys of such. And luckily, there <u>are</u> many shops that sell such online, with lots of options available in lots of different shapes and sizes.

                         But, purchasing several sex toys in such a size combination, may attract some negative attention and suspicions towards yourself. And such toys will also have to be hidden at your home, which means that they <u>can</u> be found, which again can lead to various negativities.

                         And please note that everyone of you has a tool set already <u>on</u> you, which is your very own hand and all of its fingers.

                         Though, fingers vary in sizes from human to human; so even the smallest little finger out there may be too large for some children when the training begins, especially babies and toddlers, while even the largest thumbs out there is usually not large enough for the final part of the training program.

                         One area of penetration training where many pedophiles do critical mistakes, which actually has gotten several of them caught and sent to prison, is actually hygiene practice.

                         But, an appropriate hygiene practice doesn't cost you much, <u>while</u> giving you lots of safety and security in return, making it quite foolish to overlook and ignore.

                         So, let's take a look at the two highly important subjects of hygiene practice when training a little sweetie:

                         Infection is the most common problem related to both vaginal and rectal penetration training of children. Because, the training can sometimes cause the tissues of these organs to stretch until they get micro-tears in them; and when bacteria enter these micro-tears, an infection usually occurs.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Even though no tearing happens during penetration training, children may still get internal infections from bacteria and dirt on any object being inserted, especially their vaginas.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Some of these infections will be healed all by themselves, sometimes even without the children noticing it, but the more severe ones will eventually need a doctor's attention.

                         It is actually quite common for young girls, even as young as preschoolers, to experiment with vaginal penetrations, by using whatever they got available. Many use pencils, and thus end up either braking their hymens or scratching their vaginas internally in the process. Since most pencils are full of bacteria, infections usually occur from such experiments, which eventually causes discomfort and problems for these children, making a doctor's appointment necessary.

                         Some children may also stuff different small things into their vaginas, like tiny toys or candy, which don't come out again by themselves afterwards, causing the same problems.

                         Actually, several parents have been wrongly accused for sexual abuse of their young children because of the latter issues, especially in hysterical countries like the US and UK.

                         You cannot <u>fully</u> avoid tearing from happening during any penetration training, but you can fully avoid <u>infections</u>, simply by practicing a very strict hygiene policy.

                         Without any infections, all common tearing will simply heal by themselves, while the vagina and rectum will stay all healthy.

                         <b class="h">Latex gloves</b> are highly recommended for penetration training when using custom equipment. This will make a <u>complete</u> seal between the internal body tissues and the objects being inserted, while being all smooth and soft.

                         Just strap one of the latex fingers over your selected tool, as if it was a regular condom. Or strap it all over your hand when using your fingers.

                         <b class="h">Condoms</b> do also work great as sealants. Though, they are usually made to fit an average adult penis, making them too large and redundant for small sex toys.

                         The whole point here is to create a nice and elastic sealant between the child's internal organs and the objects you insert into them, while being comfortable having them inside.

                         Right before <u>any</u> penetration training session, wash your hands at least three times in a row at a sink while ideally using very hot water and anti-bacterial soap.

                         Also wash all the equipment that are about to be inserted into the child, in the same way as you wash your hands. They must be <u>all</u> clean and shiny before you start.
                         
                         <br />

                         After a sealant has been strapped over the newly washed and all clean equipment, sterilize it with anti-bacterial fluids.

                         When using naked fingers for any penetration, you <u>must</u> cut your nails so they become hurtfully short <u>before</u> washing your hands as explained above. This will avoid scratching the child internationally <u>while</u> removing all those nasty bacterias that thrives underneath long nails.

                         Make sure that all these anti-bacterial fluids have vaporized <u>before</u> any object or finger is inserted into the child.

                         A penis don't need to be sterilized of course, but it should still be thoroughly clean in advance, as in recently washed.

                         Vaginal and anal training of children will usually contain pain at various degrees. The degree of pain will be primarily decided by your own techniques and patience; if you follow this handbook strictly, while using the longest time possible, very little pain will occur and the safer everything becomes.

                         But even if you <u>do</u> practice penetration training by the book, pain may still be experienced:

                         Mother nature has set some initial boundaries for pedophiles; and children vaginas and rectums have such boundaries, as they aren't able to handle an adult male just <u>instantly</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         To be able to enjoy a sexual intercourse with a child, we will have to stretch these boundaries that mother nature has set, thus stretch the tissues and very fabric of these little vaginas and rectums, to finally make them fit us.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It works by stretching these organs a little bit pass their natural limitations during each session, which causes micro-tears in the relevant tissues. These tears will be healed with replacement tissue cells, and these replacements make the vagina or rectum a tiny bit larger when being fully healed. And by repeating such sessions, the vagina or rectum will <u>only</u> become larger, <u>without</u> actually becoming harmed in any way.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Unfortunately, micro-tears equals pain. And even how harmless it is to expand a child's vagina or rectum correctly, pain will usually come from that process.

                         Pain <u>is</u> however very individual; and it isn't always physical:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         What's considered as quite painful for some children, is considered as just an itch for others. And children who're very skeptical by nature, especially those who got penetration anxieties, can feel things as much more painful than they really are; while the more brave, penetration curious and horny children won't be fully satisfied until you eventually come all the way inside them and fuck them hard and deep.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You might thus be very unlucky and end up with a child whom has a very low threshold of pain, which will make any penetration training highly difficult. Or, you may be extremely fortunate and end up with a very brave and horny kid whom eventually lets you slide as far inside her or him as it possibly goes, while accepting and enjoying your training program, even though tears pop out of its eyes during some parts of it.

                         Well, it all starts with <u>trust</u>. If the child trusts you, it will <u>allow</u> you to cause her or him some pain down there. If the child doesn't trust you, she or he will become extremely hard to train, with lots of crying and resistance.
                         
                         <br />

                         So, this training is <u>really</u> a test of trust, and a test of your relationship as a whole.
                         
                         <br />

                         A general method to make a child handle pain much better, is to do things <u>very</u> gently, slowly and with lots of oils. Use a large amount of time for the whole penetration process, with very small increments in sizes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         An additional way to make a child handle pain better is to combine the penetration training with social attention and sexual pleasure, as in giving the child lots of attention, love and sexual arousal during the whole training. This will make it way more acceptant to pain, and motivated to do this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You should generally be very loving and caring, and make the child feel as safe and comfortable as possible within your hands and presence. By calming the child down and making it feel relaxed and safe, it will loosen up its vaginal and rectal muscles, thus feel less physical and psychological pain.

                         Unfortunately, penetration training doesn't work on all children, so it should never be taken for granted that it will. And this is important to be aware of and prepared for as pedophiles, so you don't become too disappointed if you should ever be rejected by a child when attempting it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A failure of penetration training can happen in various ways:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some kids will reject <u>any</u> penetration before it even begins, simply because they don't have any interests what so ever in being sexually penetrated (by you).
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         Some will reject you <u>during</u> the first insertion; even totally freak out and never want to do it again.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some children will allow you to penetrate them, but still not appreciate it. Some of these may snivel, cry or even scream during the training; not necessarily because they're in any real pain, but because of penetration fear and high sensitivity.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some children may freak out if they notice any blood during the training, or notice any blood in their panties afterwards, causing them to reject any future training.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you <b class="h">force</b> a child to complete the training program, against its own will, it will have either of these outcomes:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The child will get used to it over time and eventually learn to enjoy it, and not regret it at all. Or, it may hate it all the way through the whole program, which most likely will cause the child to tell about it to other adults sooner or later.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         My personal recommendation is thus to <u>not</u> continue with the penetration training if the child is or becomes totally against it, unless you <u>really</u> know what you're doing.

                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, and as always, it will be much easier to force babies and toddlers than forcing preschoolers and elementary schoolers to complete the penetration training. Babies and toddlers can be treated pretty roughly without remembering anything, if they're younger than 4 years of age. Neither will babies and toddlers fully understand what's happening, and thus not be fully able to explain it to others.

                         <br />
                         
                         With little girls, you may of course try anal penetration training <u>instead</u> of vaginal, <u>if</u> the vaginal fails completely. That may just solve this problem easily and nicely.

                         And always remember that the boys will always be a lot more rougher and braver, and be able to handle pain much better, than any little girl; which has caused a few girl lovers to turn to boys, to be able to penetrate a child sexually.

                         An <u>optional</u> part of the penetration training, which is especially crafted for regular children in the 4-10 age span, is to practice penetration pedagogy <u>before</u> you start the real training.

                         The idea behind this pedagogy is to make a child become a <u>consensual</u> part of the whole training, making the training way more easy, predictable and exciting for you to practice. It is always for the best to have a child's <u>permission</u> before penetrating one of its most intimate and sensitive body parts.

                         Most children who are younger than 4 won't be able to fully understand this pedagogy, and should thus be omitted. These children can just be trained when and as you see fit, according to the recommended instructions in this book.

                         With adolescents, it will become more natural to instead <u>suggest</u> or just <u>try</u> fucking them while you're in the middle of a hot and arousing sexual activity. These children will be mature enough to better see and understand that penetration and fucking is a natural part of having sex together, while being able to handle first-time fucking generally well.

                         Of course, there are always gray zones at either end of these age groups, so you may want to try this penetration pedagogy on, like, mature 3 year olds and immature 11 year olds; or any older adolescent if you feel like it.

                         This pedagogy starts by suggesting penetration to the child, and advertise it in a way that will make it sound exciting and pleasurable, rather than scary and painful:

                         But, we will of course make an honest attempt, and we will do this in the most careful and correct way possible.

                         So, let's start gently, and take this incrementally, bit by bit:

                         The younger half of regular children will most likely open their eyes widely and become quite interested now, while the older half will more likely give you a stupid look or laugh some.

                         Many children have already began penetrating themselves with various stuff. I once heard about a 4 year old girl who used one of her phallic shaped toys to fuck her self regularly, which is even more likely to be the case with the older kids.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         So, we will now check if the child has ever done so before, by adding a carefully phrased question:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Have you ever tried to put something into your vagina?"

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It would be ideal if the child has already done so, and seems to having enjoyed it.

                         But regardless of which, we will continue with our important penetration pedagogy:

                         When we're about to talk about anal penetrations with either girls or boys, it will be basically similar to the vagina pedagogy, except for being a little bit easier and a little less frightening.

                         This is because the anal is a way less sensitive area among most girls, and a quite interesting and erogenous place for both girls and boys.

                         We will start gently, and take this incrementally, bit by bit:

                         I guess most kids will know about that hole, and look at that question as quite funny, so you may simply continue:

                         Well, some kids may be a little bit embarrassed about talking about this particular subject, especially the older girls.

                         Some children may even admit <u>already</u> that they have tried to insert things into their anuses, which initially is very great, but only if they enjoyed that experience.

                         Regardless of having practiced the vagina or anal pedagogy:

                         Some kids will unfortunately become quite skeptical towards this, or simply not agree to do it. In these cases, it is <u>always</u> for the best to show them tolerance and patience:

                         You will now first of all give them lots of room to make decisions within, making them feel very safe and comfortable, which tend to work in the pedophile's favor in the end.

                         Second, you will plant a seed inside their heads, and give them something special to think about, which might make them reconsider either sooner or later.

                         Just don't start pushing nor try convincing them into doing it, as that will <u>only</u> make things <u>worse</u> for the both of you.

                         Of course, if they seem to be interested in penetration, or best of all become very excited about trying it, you may then start the penetration program on the child in question.

                         If they agree to try out penetration, you may optionally prepare them some for potential pain, so they won't end up negatively surprised or feel cheated when you start.

                         So, let's start with how to warn little <u>girls</u> about vaginal pain:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                                   "If you haven't put anything into your vagina before, it means that you are a <u>virgin</u>. And being a virgin means that you have an all <u>new</u> vagina that hasn't been used before."
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   "But, the first time you put something inside the vagina and start using it, it may hurt just a little bit, because the vagina is all new and unused. This is something that <u>all</u> girls feel when they start using their vaginas, which is normal. But, the more you put smooth and soft things into it, the less pain will be felt, and the more enjoyable and nice it will become."
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   "Did that sound scary?"
                         
                              </div>

                         And then how to warn <u>all</u> children about rectal pain:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "If you haven't put anything into your anus before, it may hurt just a little bit when we begin doing it. But this is normal and something that everyone feel when they first begin doing it. And the pain will disappear after just a minute or two; because the more you put smooth and soft things into your anus, the less pain will be felt, and the more nice it will feel."
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   "Did that sound scary?"
                         
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         This will give the child an important heads up, while in the same time creating a bond of trust and confidence between the two of you; because you now show honesty and empathy, which even a 4 year old will register and appreciate.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         We won't be mentioning any blood yet, as that may be just a little bit too much to deal with at once.

                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, the child may just redecide after this warning; which <u>can</u> be handled by telling the child that you may only try this <u>very</u> carefully with <u>very</u> round and small things, <u>and</u> that she or he can stop the game whenever it wants to.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child <u>still</u> seems positive to penetration, you have just created a <u>very</u> decent basis for some <u>very</u> exciting penetration training with that cute little sweetie of yours.

                         This talk is <u>highly</u> optional, because you really don't need to inform the child about intercourses before the training starts.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This talk is all about vaginal and anal sexual intercourses, which for some children will make this penetration training even more exciting, and create an exotic goal to reach.

                         On another hand, you may risk scaring the child away, or risk feeding it with too much information at once, all of which can make it unsure about doing this.
                         
                         <br />

                         Most professional pedophiles will know which child that should be told about this and not; so if you are unsure about this, just omit this talk and instead just make an intercourse become a natural transition during your training.

                         Regardless of having warned the child about pain or not, or having talked about intercourses or not, your little sweetie will hopefully become very excited about your initial penetration suggestion, thus become all ready to try it out.

                         If this pedagogy didn't work out that well, don't panic. You <u>may</u> make another attempt sometime later, as in once again suggest trying a careful insertion of a smooth and soft object into that special vagina or anus. Just give them some time and space to digest all this, while crossing your fingers.

                         If you failed to convince a girl to participate with vaginal penetration, why not suggest anal instead?

                         As already stated, penetration pedagogy is <u>optional</u>.

                         This is because penetration pedagogy may on one hand make children <u>agree</u> to penetration training <u>before</u> it begins, while being prepared for everything that it involves. which really is the best basis to build any such training upon.

                         On another hand, any penetration pedagogy may scare some children <u>from</u> doing it with you. And in such cases, you may not even be able to at least <u>try</u> it. They may also become more anxious about performing general sexual activities with you from that point and on, as they might think from there on that you will try to penetrate them during future activities. And, some of these children would <u>otherwise</u> have agreed to a penetration attempt if you had just tried it, out of the blue, during any regular sexual activity; as they would then have realized how nice it suddenly felt, especially if they had been very sexually aroused and horny during the attempt.

                         I know, there are lots of hard decisions to be made when you become and active and practicing pedophile!

                         Without using <u>any</u> penetration pedagogy in advance of the training, it is utterly important that you make very careful and incremental penetration attempts during the activities, ideally by using very small objects at first, and even more ideally when the child is quite aroused and horny.

                         If the child reacts negatively to this, just stop it and say that you're sorry. Then try it again sometime later; and if the child still reacts negatively to it, you may then try the penetration pedagogy to see if it helps any to inform the child about vaginal or anal penetrations.
