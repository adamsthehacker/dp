                         'Child love practice' is a term within pedophilia that describes special relationships between pedophiles and children, when love and care for children is being put into practice. This means loving children in the exact same way as an average teleiophile would love an adult partner, by being there for your lover and supporting her or him, while caressing, kissing, and enjoying consensus sex together with lusts and orgasms.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, child love practice can be done at different levels, which means different levels of intensity and legality.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         An important thing for novice child lovers to know, is that you can do a lot with a child before it actually becomes illegal in most countries. And you can even go pretty far and do illegal things without it being easily detected nor proved. You can actually go pretty far and experience delicious satisfactions <u>without</u> taking much of risks. Or, you may go for the very top level, have a penetrative sexual intercourse with a child, and risk everything to access the very <u>core</u> of God's Heaven.

                         <br />

                         There are 5 main levels of child love practice, each one containing allowed and restricted interactions with children:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="level_1"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <b>Level 1</b> | <span style="color:#008000">very secure</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The first level of child love practice is ideal for all newcomers who are just starting out being around and getting to know children, and probably the place where most pedophiles start at anyway when interacting with children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Not to mention, being ideal for pedophiles who feel like they can't control their lusts fully when they're around children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It's also an ideal level for anyone who have lots to loose in life, or a very important reputation to keep at status quo.

                         This level is <u>limited</u> to the following rules:

                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This level is <u>bulletproof</u> and cannot put you in any trouble; unless someone is making false claims, which is quite rare.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Even if you should become tempted to push the boundaries, you have already made sure that other adults are around, while not being all that intimate with them in the first place, which will discourage and suppress such impulses.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But, it <u>can</u> become pretty frustrating for pedophiles to be around children, and interact with them both mentally and physically, while not being able to do <u>anything</u>; especially when it becomes more intimate, like reading books for young children on your lap. But, if you know about <a class="set3" href="urge_control.html#start" target="_blank">urge control</a>, this level can be practiced comfortably, safely and securely.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                    
                         
                         It is very rewarding just being among children and having a great time together. Pedophiles are usually very popular among kids, because the kids detect their unique interest and love for them, which is a nice experience for all parties.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Many pedophiles stop at this level, just to be on the fully safe and comfortable side regarding the society and laws. Because, this level allows them to interact with children <u>while</u> sleeping perfectly well every single night.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         <b>Level 2</b> | <span style="color:#408000">reasonably secure</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The second level of child love practice is all about pushing the limits just a little bit further, but <u>still</u> stay fully legal.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This is usually the next logical step for newbie child lovers to move to, or any other for that matter who wants more intimacy with children, as more intimacy this step will provide.

                         This is actually pretty close to the default child love level for regular parents, babysitters and daycare workers.

                         But, this level is not especially recommended for anyone who has a very important reputation to keep, as it will involve certain interactions that some people may look at as quite intimate; and probably a little bit too intimate if either the child isn't yours, or if it happens very often and intensively.
                         
                         <br />

                         Whilst being fully legal interactions, the children may actually tell about the most intimate ones, which may cause some alarms to go off. Imagine little Sophia coming home from preschool and tells that uncle Joe, who works there, likes to kiss her mouth and tickle her a lot. Legal? Yes. Assuring? No.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You won't be sent to jail if something like the latter happens, but it can quickly become a scratch on your reputation, with various social and career related consequences.

                         <br />
                         
                         And it's definitely not a recommended level for those who feel that they have trouble controlling their lusts around children; because when you start to e.g. kiss those red and wet little mouths, your sexuality may suddenly switch on fully.

                         But, this level will definitely make things way more intimate, thus way more rewarding for the pedophiles who can handle it and control themselves; being able to be all alone together, really squeeze them when hugging them, smelling them, feeling their lips onto yours when kissing, and both see them and legally touch them in all nude during intimate care.

                         The third level of child love practice is the first level that actually becomes sexual. In other words, you will now get an orgasm while being close to and intimate with a child. Though, you will only touch <u>yourself</u>, not the child's genitals.

                         This is the next natural step to take for most 2nd level child lovers who want to go further with child love practice, and experience sexual releases <u>while</u> interacting with kids.

                         The main part of this level is to masturbate yourself while doing any of the listed activities below. And ideally, hide it so neither the child nor anyone else detects it.

                         This level is less secure of obvious reasons: the child may notice that your behavior changes, thus become unsure about you, or even scared of you. You may also get caught by the child, or by any adult around, while satisfying yourself. And neither scenario will become pleasant to experience.

                         This is referred to as <b class="h">passive sexual abuse</b> in court, and is considered as fully illegal by law, in most countries.

                         However, it will become enormously hard taking you to court and <u>prove</u> what you did. Thus, most pedophiles who do get caught for this, do get away with it. But your social status and whole life in general will nevertheless change for the worse.

                         But, and a quite big one that is, if you <u>manage</u> to keep this hidden from the child and your surroundings, you will actually be able to have passive sex with children, and thus experience something extremely wonderful as a genuine pedophile. And if being very careful, you can keep on doing this forever, thus get lots of sexual rewards in your life, in the same time as staying safe, unconcerned and happy.

                         This is a very great level to stop at if you want to stay as safe as possible, while <u>still</u> being able to experience sex with kids.

                         The fourth level of child love practice is the level that becomes fully sexual, and the child will be introduced to sex while being fully conscious about it.

                         When a child is fully aware about what happens, you will get a 2-way sexual relationship, which is a very powerful experience for a genuine pedophile: not only will you be fiddling with children and getting orgasms while doing so, but you will also be communicating sexually. You'll smile at each other, giggle, whisper, and see how the child responds to caressing, touching and sexual stimuli. This is a whole new playground for all pedophiles to set themselves loose within.

                         However, things become very risky and illegal at this level, as this is the first level that introduces <b class="h">prison time</b> as a possible risk, making it a less ideal step for the faint hearted pedophiles who got a lot to loose in life.

                         But, this is also the level that many pedophiles think it's worth dying for; because there are no real comparisons in life to having real sex with real children as genuine pedophiles.

                         And since penetration is forbidden at this level, you can't be prosecuted for premature rape, which usually limits the consequences and prison time significantly if caught.

                         Of course, you may have sex with a child while it's asleep, which might seem safer to many of you, but can actually become less safe than if the child actually had been awake:
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Because, there will always be that risk of the child waking up while you're doing it, thus suddenly finding itself in a critical situation that it wasn't prepared for at all, causing it to freak out in many different ways. Some children have even pretended to be asleep, in pure fear of what's happening, and then told about it the very next day to another adult. Thus, sleeping kids aren't as safe as most probably think.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Having sex with sleeping children isn't a problem however, if the children are already introduced and used to sex in their awaken states. Sometimes it can be nice to have sex with sleeping children, who're quite active and restless in their awaken states, giving you the opportunity to enjoy them while being all calm and still, and enjoy them over very long and intense sessions, like warm little play dolls.

                         The fifth level of child love practice is the level that goes all the way to town. This is where penetration will occur, as in sliding slowly into a wet kiddie mouth, or a wet <u>and</u> supertight kiddie vagina or bum, and ejaculate far inside it.

                         <u>Any</u> sexual penetration of children equals <b class="h">premature rape</b> by most laws worldwide, and is the ultimate crime to commit with the worst consequences and hardest  prison times.

                         <br />

                         But, this risk is the price you'll have to pay to experience fully sexual intercourses with children, all the way from babies to adolescents, and enter the very <u>core</u> of God's Heaven.

                         If you can live with the risk of getting caught for something like this, this is the level to proceed to. The sexual satisfaction that you get from such child love practice goes far beyond <u>any</u> stimulating drugs available on this planet; which usually puts most fears in its shadow anyway, sooner or later.

                         As you now have learned, child love practice can actually be done on several different and specific levels.

                         Ideally, you should choose one level that fits <u>you</u> best, and stick to that level and its rules. Of course, you are free to move to a higher level whenever you feel like in the future.

                         However, knowing what level to enter and stay on can become quite difficult for newbies. This is a decision that you'll have to make all by your own, by thinking thoroughly through your life and what you can afford loosing in it and not, and how much you're willing to sacrifice to experience the sort of child love practice that you want the most.

                         The most interesting level however, is probably the <a class="set3" href="#level_3" target="_blank">3rd level</a>, as it is relatively safe to practice while still being extremely powerful regarding excitement, sexual arouse and release.

                         Just remember the simple rule of child love levels: the higher you go, the less secure your life becomes, but the closer to Heaven you <u>do</u> get.
