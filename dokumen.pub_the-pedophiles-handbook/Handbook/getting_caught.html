                         It's only getting darker and colder as we move deeper and deeper into the abyss. Spiders and scorpions are now crawling up your legs, inside your pants, and your flickering candle is barely lit in the humid wind. But try breathing calmly, shake your legs, and keep those candles lit, while we are moving further through this horrific but very important guide.

                         What most pedophiles fear the most, especially those who're practicing illegal child love, is getting caught. And this fear is perfectly normal, and a price that all active pedophiles simply must pay to be able to make real love to real children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, if <u>you</u> are one of those who live with this fear everyday, you are definitely not alone!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         This fear is so strong because getting caught is obviously a very bad thing to happen, with severe consequences, depending on the situation and country. However, it doesn't <u>have</u> to become all that bad after all, as it all depends on <u>how</u> you handle things <u>if</u> this should ever happen in the future.

                         By being unprepared and handling things wrong, you may end up in a harsh prison for a very long time. By being prepared and handling things correctly, you can avoid prison, and even limit the potential damage to your social life.

                         Getting caught is <u>not</u> equal to the end of your life; as many pedophiles actually think like this, and therefore surrender to the law enforcement and court system in their shock and sudden loss of motivation to fight for their freedom.

                         Getting caught is all about <u>how</u> you handle things, both socially and legally, from the moment it happens; which doesn't have to mean any end of anything, but rather the beginning of a very important experience and wisdom.

                         There are basically two ways for us to get caught:

                         <br />

                         And, getting caught for illegal child love practice is usually a chained event that begins with getting caught by a civilian, who reports it to the law enforcement, which leads to an arrest, and then to the court, and eventually to a prison.

                         Pedophiles who get caught by civilians, are usually caught by a close family member. It usually happens when the child tells about it, but it can also happen by accident if anyone suddenly appears and sees you in the middle of the act.

                         These confrontations vary a lot between different situations and people, but they all have in common being less pleasant experiences for all parties involved.

                         The most important and basic thing to do when this happens, is to always stay <u>calm</u> during the confrontation, at least on the outside; even though if it becomes hot, and even though if someone is hitting you and screaming at you.

                         <br />
                         
                         By being calm in such situations, you will automatically calm the other person down as well, while appearing more innocent and less guilty. You will generally create a much better foundation to handle all this upon, contrary to freaking out or getting an anxiety attack yourself.

                         Preparations are thus very important. You must repeatedly lay down on a couch while being all alone, and imagine e.g. your wife becoming hysterical because she thinks you have molested her beautiful little princess. It is not fun imagining such scenarios; but by imagining them inside your head, you will be better prepared to handle them if they should happen, and you will less likely end up in shock and anxiety yourself.

                         When this happens for real, your heart rate will go through the roof, your rate of breathing will increase along with your heart, your face will become incredibly warm, as adrenaline is being shot into your bloodstream to prepare you for battle. Think about me! Think about this handbook! Remind yourself about the importance of staying calm! Remind yourself that this is <u>not</u> the end of the world, it is just a battle that you <u>can</u> win <u>if</u> you handle things correctly from that particular minute!

                         If you should one day be confronted by an angry person who accuses you for having sexually abused a particular child, because the child has told about it, your very first response should always be <b class="h">denial</b> > <b class="h">surprise</b> > <b class="h">defense</b>:

                                   "I'm <u>not</u> a person who does such things to children!"

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         First, you express an immediate denial. Then, you seem to grasp the reality of the accusation, thus you become hugely surprised, which makes you ask why. Finally, you get yourself together and start standing up for yourself and defending your own person. And all this, while staying basically <u>calm</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This would be the most psychologically correct reaction for an innocent person, which requires just 3 simple sentences. Though, all people react differently to such accusations, so you do have lots of room to work within. But it <u>is</u> always best to keep this acting as simple as possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And from that point and on, it is very important that you keep your focus on <u>not</u> understanding what this is about, <u>nor</u> why it is happening. And this should basically be your main argument and defense during the whole accusation and attack; just repeat that you don't understand why this is happening, nor why she or he accuses you of such things, and keep on repeating this as answers, in different ways.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will quickly notice how easy it really is to answer difficult questions in this regard, by using such simple and repetitive rhetorics, based on not understanding and not knowing.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This trick will make it exceptionally hard for the accuser to interrogate you and put you in a difficult spot, and exceptionally easy for you to avoid the accuser while not saying anything stupid that will make the accuser right.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The accusers are usually very upset, some can even become violent, but just defend yourself physically as much as possible while denying it and not understanding anything.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most of these confrontations and accusations are rarely based on any real scientific proofs, only the child's words against yours. So, never give up denying, even if you think there might be evidence against you somewhere.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If any evidence should be presented by the accuser, which would be hard to explain away, keep on telling him or her that you don't understand how or why this evidence exists. Because, some accusers actually lie about having evidence in the first place, making it easy for a frightened and inexperienced pedophile to confess.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Just keep on denying, and keep on not understanding!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The less you say, the better it is. Repeat yourself as much as possible, by using the three sentences above as your basis, and <u>avoid</u> trying to explain things or explain your way out of it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you feel confident in acting, you may additionally simulate crying, while in the same time adding sympathy towards the child, like saying that the child must have some kind of a problem or issue for saying things like these. If you handle this well, you can score some really high innocence-points.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the accuser threatens to call the police, tell that she or he should probably do that, because the cops and their child psychiatrists, along with the child protection services, will most likely sort this misunderstanding out.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now you will sound <u>extremely</u> confident and innocent, while <u>indirectly</u> reminding the accuser about the huge mess the all of you may end up in. You can only win here; because if they really have certain proofs, or if they really want to, they <u>will</u> call the police anyway.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, what most concerned guardians want to accomplish with such confrontations, is to see and analyze your <u>reaction</u>. So, by being just partially upset and not understanding what's happening, while being very confident, you might just give them the reassurance that they need to not call the police.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And from there, it will only be a waiting game; either they will contact the police about the matter or they will not.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Regardless of who confronted you, just keep on living your life as nothing happened. Go outside and pickup your mail. Talk to your neighbors. Go to work. Cut your lawn and do some gardening work. Play off an epic arrogance, as this will further show everyone around that you're confident and innocent.

                         The first thing to do is to fall down on your knees and just beg for mercy. Tell the accuser that you have a serious problem that you don't know how to handle, and you want help for it, instead of being sent to prison to have this problem become even worse. If you have some acting skills, try to cry and become as pathetic as humanly possible.

                         If pathetic begging doesn't work, you must move to the next level, which is reminding the accuser about all the bad things that will come out of reporting this to the law enforcement:

                         <br />
                         
                         Continue to beg the accuser to think about all this before making any rash decisions, and that you can solve this together as a family instead of going through all those things, while you're willing to do <u>anything</u> to make things right.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If the accuser has become hysterical, it might be hard to convince her or him that this is the best solution for everyone. If the accuser is able to think clearly, these reminders will usually make the accuser think twice about reporting it to the police. Because, these arguments are actually true, which is the nice thing about them.

                         <br />

                         If you are physically stronger than the accuser, and the accuser is totally hysterical and not in any condition to listen wisely to these important arguments, you may want to physically restrain the person until she or he calms down enough to start thinking more clearly again. And be very careful and caring while doing so, while still begging for mercy. Never become angry or use any violence when doing this.
                         
                         <br />

                         Just keep on begging the accuser to agree to solve this <u>internally</u> within the family.
                         
                         <br />

                         Usually, there's a significant difference between female and male accusers. Females tend to forgive more easily, especially if you exploit her mother instincts by acting like a kid, like crying, holding onto her legs or hands while being on the floor, just begging like a pathetic little person. However, if a male has caught you, it can turn out pretty differently. There will be little to no empathy and forgiveness, it can even become a violent and life threatening session.

                         I'm afraid your options aren't that many when being totally screwed like this, so this is all you can do. Just beg for mercy and try as much as possible appealing to the accusers empathy, and remind her or him about all the negative things that will come out of this, while simply crossing your fingers.

                         From my own work and experience within psychology, while being some really good news for all pedophiles who want to practice pedophilia within their own close family, most pedophiles who get caught by close family members, do get away with it in one way or another.
                         
                         <br />

                         Some families are living what you may call 'perfect lives': dad is a dentist with a fat salary, and mom is the community hero and number one soccer mom. She has a Mercedes SUV and dad got a big flat BMW. They have this nice large house in an upper class community, and beautiful looking children with lots of beautiful looking friends. Do you really think mommy would throw all that into the trash bin and become the community <u>clown</u> if she finds daddy underneath little Jane's Barbie duvet one night? Well, I don't think so.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Money and wealth don't actually have to be the thing that decides this either, as long as the family is 'perfect' and has a decent to great social status and rep in the community.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It gets even better if we look at small (church) communities, especially religious families with a superb reputation in town. They will very little likely make a total legal and social mess out of things if sexual abuse becomes revealed within the family. Mom will slap dad's face hard and tell him to stay out of little Jane's bedroom from now on. Or, dad takes Jane's big brother out to the barn and beats him up so hard that he can barely crawl out of it when done. If grandpa, and the founder of the farm, gets caught, nothing happens. And, case closed.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Rich families who own large corporations are probably the families who'll keep such secrets and protect them with their own lives. And poor little Jane will just have to take and handle whatever comes her way during the dark nights.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Well, it also helps if you're the sole bread feeder of your family, the one who works 8-12 hours a day to keep them all alive and off the streets. I think mommy will think twice about reporting you to the police if you're ever caught far inside little Jane after a long and hard day at work.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Many of you just don't know how powerful social status and social happiness really is within the human species, and what lengths and strengths most people are willing to go to keep that at status quo.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Pedophilia is also the biggest taboo in the human culture, second to cannibalism, so even if a child tells about it in one way or another, many parents will just ignore it and go into denial mode. They may even slap the child's face and tell it not to say such things anymore.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Of course, not all close family members will just ignore it. Some will confront the pedophile in question, but most likely just slap his face and threaten to report him to the police if he ever does that again. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some actually do get reported, even before being confronted, but that is actually quite rare within close family relationships.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Families are special. They tend to protect each other and sort things out internally and privately instead of exposing themselves. They have empathy and sympathy for each other, and don't want someone they love and care for to end up in a prison. Neither do they want to break up the family and gain an unfortunate reputation. Sometimes, the innocent party takes the whole blame, like mom blaming herself for not giving dad enough sex or not being there enough for him.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Families are special indeed; you would have been amazed to know how many pedophiles who actually get away with illegal child love practice when caught within close families. 

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you live within a tight and loving family, espeically one of the previously mentioned, it will actually become pretty safe to practice illegal child love with your close relative children.

                         <br />
                         
                         But when I say 'safe' in this regard, I just mean initially safe from being sent to prison. You may still loose a lot. You may actually loose your own children and your whole family, altogether and forever.

                         <br />

                         Unfortunately, I can't say the same about remote family relations, as I can about close family relations; especially not friends. work colleagues, neighbors and strangers.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                    
                         
                         Because, within such circumstances, you will most likely not gain that unique empathy and sympathy if caught; which can quickly lead to an urge for revenge towards you, as in either reporting you directly to the police, hurting you badly, or making you 'disappear' silently from the surface of the earth.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Whatever situation you may face as a caught pedophile, as in caught by civilians, always try to keep your head cool and use my recommended instructions, which really can make the difference between freedom and bars.

                         And if <u>that</u> fails, you really have done whatever you could.

                         If your actions are ever reported to the law enforcement, and they decide to come for you, there will be no mercy; thus, no point in begging for any when they confront you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The law enforcement will react immediately and do everything in their power, within the laws of your country, even bend the laws a little to their advantage, to take you down as hard as possible, and lock you up in prison for as long as possible.

                         If you do just <u>one</u> little mistake during this process, which unfortunately many pedophiles and general suspects do, you may risk ending up in prison with a long sentence to serve.

                         But, if you do things <u>right</u> from the very beginning to the very end, you may just slip away from their hands like a lubed eel, and escape both charges and prison time all together.

                         The first thing you will need to learn now, is that all law enforcement agents, whether being your local police or federal agents, do this for a living. This is their work, and they have educated themselves at schools and gone through training camps to become what they are. They go to work every single day, gaining even more experience with time, and this is what they do and what they know how to do.

                         So, what do you think happens when these officers use their power and experience to arrest you and interrogate you? And pull you through the whole legal system? You, who don't know anything about how this works! You, who don't know anything about what to do or say! You, who have never done this before at all! What do you think happens?
                         
                         <br />

                         Well, they can very easily screw you all over, and you won't even know what struck you before you sit behind bars.

                         In other words, the plains aren't even. <u>They</u> have got the upper hand, and they will use that hand to smash you down and cause you to make one mistake after another, without you even thinking about it nor being aware of it, making sure that little you get as screwed as you can possible get.

                         They have actually been <u>educated</u> to handle interrogations of suspects, which really is just a bag full of dirty tricks, a bag they crave to open and use against you as soon as they can. They use special psychological interrogation techniques to break you and form you, like clay in their hands. They know all about interrogations of suspect, while most civilians and pedophiles don't. You will be in <u>their</u> territory, weak and lost, and initially have no clues about how to navigate through and get out of it. This will make you feel nervous and feel weak, thus be at high risk of making several important mistakes.

                         This is why it is <u>so</u> important for all active pedophiles to learn how this works and be prepared for it, even as pessimistic as it might sound, because you <u>will</u> be grateful when you finally lie in your own warm bed and thinking with a great smile over you face that you actually <b class="h">got away with it</b>.

                         If you are a practicing pedophile, or soon to be one, the very first thing for you to do, as of right <u>now</u>, even as a free and optimistic pedophile, is to locate a local lawyer, and remember its telephone number and address in your head.

                         <br />

                         Ideally, you should do some research and try locating and choosing a lawyer who has experience with pedophile crimes, and learn about his or her availability and fees.

                         This is not about being pessimistic, but all about giving yourself an important insurance. It's just like getting yourself an insurance when buying a very expensive car; it doesn't mean that you're a bad driver or that you will crash anytime soon, it's just an insurance, nothing more and nothing less.

                         If you don't have any extra money now, start saving some at a savings account in your bank. Lawyers are expensive beasts; and the more expensive, usually the better they are.

                         <br />

                         If you are poor and don't have any money, neither any resources for saving, you will either have to take a chance on a cheap lawyer or take an assigned one for free.

                         It is always best to have a decent and expensive lawyer, but it is still fully possible to escape prison with a cheap or assigned one too, as long as you know the basics.

                         The lightest sort of police confrontations for pedophiles happen when a pedophile only is a suspect of a certain crime. The police don't have any valid proofs, so they can't get an arrest order on him. Neither do they have any other valid reasons to arrest him, so they make an attempt to confront him and take him in for an interrogation.

                         It is sad to say that this is where many pedophiles, and many criminals in general, make serious mistakes that actually send them to prison in the end; simply because they don't know how this system works, they aren't prepared for this at all, and neither do they know their legal rights.

                         Most law enforcement agents are very authoritative, so it can become extremely difficult for you to stand up against them. They will be patronizing, they will lie, they will try to fool and scare you, in the same time as being very authoritative. Some of them can even be dirty cops, and try some crazy stunts to scare you, but these morons are luckily among a minority.

                         You must therefore prepare <u>every</u> single bone in your body to stand strong on your civil rights and avoid them as much as possible, in the most careful and polite way possible.

                         They can visit your doorstep and knock on your door, or confront you outdoors in public, whenever they want to and as much as they want to.

                         And now we get to the first mistake that most pedophiles do, and probably the biggest one, which is thinking that they've actually been arrested, even if they are not. Or, they think that they'll have to comply to anything the agents tell them to do.

                         They usually come to your home and introduce themselves.

                         It is now very important that you immediately take control over the situation and leaving them psychologically less powerful and authoritative, by opening your door, going outside, and closing the door behind you:

                         Law enforcement agents just <u>love</u> to come inside your home and look around, and make you feel inferior to their authority. This is a part of their psychological tricks and games.

                         By letting them inside, they can more or less move freely around, making it hard to get rid of them and making you uncomfortable by having them there. You will be serving them way more rights than they actually have. and they will generally intrude your privacy, which isn't okay at all.

                         When being questioned by law enforcement agents, whether they come to your door or stop you in the streets, you are actually not required to answer them. Neither should you, as any answer you give may actually incriminate yourself.

                         And then go back inside and close the door. Or just leave them quietly if they approached you outside.

                         If they ask to look into your car, or into anything that is your legal property, especially if they ask for a blood or DNA test, ask if they have a warrant for any of this, just as when they attempt to <a class="set3" href="#asking_to_come_inside" target="_blank">come inside</a> your home.

                         <br />

                         Without a warrant, <u>never</u> let them search through anything of yours, and <u>never</u> agree to giving them any blood or DNA.

                                   This is important to do right away, as it will become evidence of an illegal house entrance and search by law officials.

                         It is important to be additionally prepared for their reactions to your lacking cooperation:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some law enforcement agents may act very kind and gentle while approaching you with questions, like good friends of yours, and make you feel like a bad person and citizen for not letting them question you or invade your privacy. But always keep in mind that this is just a part of their <u>job</u> and <u>acting</u>.

                         <br />
                         
                         They are <u>not</u> your friends, they're just agents who are only doing a job. They care <u>none</u> about you as a person <u>nor</u> what happens to you. And please remember this, all the time!

                         <br />

                         Some may also make you feel like a guilty person, like telling you that you look very guilty by not cooperating and answering just a few simple questions. They may even make you feel stupid, by smiling or laughing at you. But this is also a part of their <u>job</u> and <u>acting</u>, as they're only trying to manipulate you to incriminate yourself. Remember this too!

                         If they at anytime ask you why they can't come inside your home, why you wont come with them for some questioning, and why they can't search your belongings or get your DNA; or if they follow you down the streets and nag you about your lacking cooperation, while trying to make you angry; always give them this answer:

Stop and listen to what they have to say; but as soon as you have made your stand and reminded them about your civil rights, you are free to leave them by law. Never become quarrelsome nor aggressive; this will give them a nice opportunity to put you in cuffs and take you in.

                         <u>Never</u> try to run or drive away from them if they approach you directly; because statistically you will loose, and then end up in a much worse situation than you where in initially.

                         Usually, a law enforcement agent must have an arrest warrant to make a legal arrest. But he does have the authority to arrest you without a warrant under special circumstances: if he catches you while permitting a crime, or there's significant evidence against you on the spot.

                         Several cops however, arrest people without valid reasons, which means that the arrest becomes <u>invalid</u>, thus they can't keep you at the police station once you arrive there. And this is <u>utterly</u> important to know, because being arrested doesn't <u>have</u> to mean that you're <u>arrested</u>; as many cops <u>do</u> overuse their authority, usually to make you feel scared and inferior, so it'll become easier to break you during an interrogation.

                         Thus, if they arrest you <u>without</u> a warrant, it can actually mean that they lack any solid evidence against you, probably in the same time as being a little bit desperate.
                         
                         <br />

                         If they show you an arrest warrant on paper however, your situation becomes considerably worse, as <u>that</u> usually means that they have some important evidence against you.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Regardless of how the arrest goes down, just cooperate and keep your head cold during the whole process.

                         They usually inform you about what you're being arrested for, and then inform you about your rights, while finally cuffing you up and leading you to a squad car.

                         The most important thing from now on, in addition to being cooperative and polite, is to <u>close</u> and <u>seal</u> your mouth!

                         <u>Many</u> pedophiles, and other criminals who get arrested, begin to babble. They think they have verbal control over the situation and that they can easily talk their way out of the arrest. But instead, they usually end up underestimating the high experience and sneaky tricks of the law enforcement agents, in the same time as forgetting that everything they say can and will be used against them as evidence in court. Like, if you're caught lying or making verbal mistakes at this stage, you will be serving them evidence against you on a silver platter. Many criminals end up incriminating themselves during the arrest process, and all the way to a long prison sentence, simply by using their <u>mouths</u>.

                         Most cops do start talking to you about the crime you've been accused for, on the way to their headquarters, to make sure that you incriminate yourself as much as possible, as soon as possible. And they have the legal right to do so, as long as they have already informed you about the right to keep silence. Though, in some countries, the police aren't required to inform you about this right.

                         There are however a few questions you must answer by law:

                                   <li>Your name, address and phone number.</li>
                                   <li>Your age, birth date and social security number.</li>
                                   <li>Questions related to being a witness to a crime.</li>
                                                  
                              </ul>

                         <br />
                         
                         You don't have to answer questions that can incriminate yourself, so be <u>careful</u> when they claim that you <u>must</u> answer certain questions.

                         Whenever you're unsure, tell them that you <u>will</u> answer their questions and fully cooperate verbally, as soon as you have your lawyer present for consultation.

                         As soon as you arrive at the police station, you are usually led to an interrogation room for questioning.

                         <br />

                         The law enforcement agents will try to interrogate you without a lawyer present. They will try a large number of tricks to make you talk, incriminate yourself, and confess in tears:

                         One trick they use a lot if you seem to be a kind, decent and obeying person during the arrest, thus possibly a weak person in their eyes, is fake empathy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They basically show a great deal of sympathy and empathy towards you in the interrogation room.

                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         They may tell you that it can't be easy to have such feelings for children, they want to help you go through all this, and they will offer you help to deal with your sexual lusts. They may tell you that you will feel a lot better after you've talked about what you've done and come clean with everything, and that this can be your chance to make an important change in your life. And so forth.

                         This is just a <u>trick</u> they use to try making you like them, trust them, and finally open up to them. Ideally for them, you will eventually crack into tears because of the pressure and fear of being arrested for such a crime, thus end up putting your whole life into their hands and singing like a bird about every single thing you've done in life.

                         After they are done with you however, and your confession is on paper with your signature, they will laugh and drink coffee together, and mimic your pathetic behavior. Some have probably made bets on who could make you crack first. I have actually seen this more than once with my own eyes during some of my work with the police. It is a much used interrogation tactic, but a <u>tactic</u> is all it is. <b class="h">They don't care!</b>

                         Many pedophiles do actually struggle with their sexual orientation, and struggle with things they've done. So, it <u>can</u> become tempting to just come clean in that interrogation room with those 'nice' and 'friendly' agents. But, when you sit inside a tight prison cell, with only metal and bricks around, and a mentally instable cell mate in the upper bunk, a cell you will spend your next 10-30 years inside, was that cry and confession really worth it?

                         You will sit there in that prison cell and rot in pure misery, while the cops who arrested you have already forgotten about you and are living their own happy lives. They don't care about you, nor are they going to help you in any ways. So, was that cry and confession worth it?

                         If you confess, you will <u>instead</u> screw yourself big time. And everything that matters to you will be <u>screwed</u> just as much.

                         If you confess, everything that matters to you in life will be gone, and everything you fear in life will become a reality and a part of your next 10-30 years.

                         <br />

                         This is just a psychological trick they use to get confessions!

                         <br />

                         Unfortunately, it works well, as many people have confessed in such situations, and screwed everything up as far as it goes. They could have walked out of the police station free as birds the very same day, but instead ended up in jail with a long sentence ahead, because they where fooled like this.

                         And there you have yet another reason to shut the fuck up until your lawyer is present!

                         You have probably heard this term in movies, but it is actually used a lot in real life interrogation scenarios.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         One cop starts interrogating you in a very nasty way, by being quite unpleasant. He will probably use a considerable amount of time interrogating you in this way. But then he usually leaves the room, for some fabricated reason, and another cop comes in, usually his parter.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The second one is very nice and emphatic, and very pleasant to speak to. He seems to be a humble guy that really understands you. So, you want him to be in the room as much as possible, not that other guy; especially if you are very uncomfortable in this situation, which is easily noticeable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But after a short while, the nice guy leaves the room, and back in comes that nasty cop again. And he stays with you yet again for a considerable amount of time, just being an ass and nagging you. You just want to punch his face, but that's never a good idea during any interrogation.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Then they switch again, probably a few times, hoping that you will eventually crack and confess to the nice cop, so you don't have to deal with that nasty one anymore, and generally just get over with all this as quickly as possible.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         But once again, this is yet another <u>trick</u>. Look at it as a theatrical act, and imagine them being just actors on a scene.

                         This is one of the last and desperate attempts to make you crack. And this is all about scaring you into a confession.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         As soon as they start to threaten you and your future, you can actually start to calm down. Now you can be pretty assured that they really don't have much on you, so they need your confession on paper or tape to get you convicted.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Pedophiles are almost <u>always</u> threatened about prison. They will say that if you cooperate now and confess to your charges immediately, they will make sure you get the lightest sentence possible and protection in prison. Or else, they will make sure you get the hardest sentence, in the hardest prison, in the hardest department. They may add some horror stories about rape, castrations and killings of pedophiles in prisons too. They may even show you pictures of nasty prison cells and showers, body trauma from beating and stabbing, and rough inmates with big tattoos; all to scare you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some may go even further, and say they know some prison officers who will place you in the same cell as a rapist or killer who hates pedophiles, unless you talk or confess right <u>now</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In reality, this is yet again just bullshit. If you really end up in a prison, you will end up in the same prison, the same department, the same random cell, and have the same rights as all other prisoners, regardless of what you say or don't say to the police during the interrogation. And the prison sentence will be decided by a judge, not by these clowns.

                         The important thing here is this: if they really have any solid evidence on you, they won't be threatening you to get a confession. Then they will just book you and throw you in jail, and end of story. If they act like this, they usually <u>need</u> your confession to charge you, which you must <u>not</u> give them.

                         Some agents lie directly to your face to get a confession. This is actually allowed in many countries and regions of the world, and is thus often used as yet another last resort if they need a confession to charge you.

                         This trick is very effective if combined with <a class="set3" href="#scare_tactics" target="_blank">Scare Tactics</a>!

                         <br />

                         They may say that they have all the evidence needed to charge you with the crimes you're being accused for having committed; but of course, if you confess, everything will be so much better for you in the end.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         They may also say that they have a witness against you, or someone who have seen your actions. So, you're screwed, and a confession is your only way out of this mess.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         In one case that I witnessed, the charged person got a letter from his mother during the interrogation, who plead him to confess, and wrote that this was the best thing for him to do. He was very attached to his mother, and trusted her fully, so he confessed in a long cry. The problem however, was that his mother never wrote to him, and wasn't even aware of the arrest nor the letter. The cops made the letter themselves!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you have a real life pedophile friend, and the both of you are being interrogated, they may say that your friend is about to tell on you. They will then advice you to confess right now, and be the one who confesses first and gets the lightest punishment. They may also say that your friend has just confessed and sold you out, and then advice you to confess at once to strike back and save yourself. And of course, they will say the same thing to your friend!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you do have a real life pedophile friend whom you cooperate with while practicing child love, it is utterly important that you talk about this together and are prepared for this if both of you should get caught simultaneously; because this happens a lot within other crimes.

                         Don't believe <u>anything</u> they claim, which seems to put you in a really bad position and situation if you don't confess.

                         Probably the most important thing to be aware of, which may sound a little bit too much, but has actually been used to convict several criminals, is the extraction of evidence while you're being interrogated.

                         The police may have your DNA from a child, but they don't have enough evidence to get a warrant to extract your DNA at the police station for a comparison.

                         If they haven't already scanned your fingerprints, make sure that you protect your fingerprints as well, by never touching anything with your bare hands while being at the station.

                         For <u>some</u> pedophiles, these precautions may actually make the difference between freedom and a long prison sentence!

                         Some law enforcement agencies will offer you a chance to prove your innocence by taking a lie detector test. These test are done with special machines that are called polygraphs.
                         
                         <br />

                         A polygraph isn't actually a real lie detector, which many people think it is. It is instead a psychological stress detector.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You connect the machine to a subject's body with several cables that will monitor its breathing, pulse, blood pressure and sweat. There are also some advanced polygraphs out there that will observe even more body functions. And the idea is to observe and analyze these body functions while asking many different questions, and look for unusual body responses during answering that might be interpreted as lies, like a sudden increased rate of breathing or sweating.

                         Polygraphs are controversial and depreciated within science, because no one has yet been able to prove scientifically that they are accurate tools within the law enforcement and court system. And this is why all results from polygraphs are banned as valid evidence in most court systems worldwide.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some scientific tests have shown that:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         An honest person who really don't lie, can actually fail a polygraph test if that person is naturally more nervous than the average person. His stress symptoms may peak at uncomfortable questions, even if he tells the truth. So, the polygraph says he's lying, when he really is not.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         A sociopath however, who rarely get stressed and actually gets calm and self-confident while lying, can easily walk such tests and lie until his face goes green, while the polygraph says he's telling the truth.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Some persons are just notorious lairs. They have been lying all their life and they lie so much that they actually believe most of their own lies. They will also successfully walk most polygraph tests while lying.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         There are also several psychological disorders and illnesses that will make a person fail a polygraph test, either in his favor or disfavor.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         So, there are just too many uncertainties and variables that make these devices less credible, and the reason why they haven't been officially and scientifically approved.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, many law enforcement agents, and polygraph advocates especially, still swears to them and use them on suspects in their investigations. But it has to be volunteer, and the results from the test can never be used in court as evidence. Thus, they only use the results as an unofficial guide in their investigations.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you ever get asked to perform a lie detector test, tell them that your default security policy doesn't allow you to perform such tests, because they are scientifically depreciated and not accepted as evidence in the court of law.

                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         These are the exact reasons why you should always have a lawyer present during any interrogation with any law enforcement agent. It is utterly unethical for any agent to interrogate suspects while the suspect is untrained within law, and being all alone and mentally vulnerable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This is a civil right that most people in the developed world have, and a civil right that everyone should use if they ever end up arrested and interrogated.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Don't open your mouth until your lawyer sits right besides you in the interrogation room, and listen <u>carefully</u> to his or her advices during the whole interrogation.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If they still try to interrogate you without a lawyer present, even though you've made it very clear that you require a lawyer present, make sure your lawyer learns <u>all</u> about this when you meet him or her later.

                         Just try your very best to stay quiet and avoid their questions, even though it can be hard.

                         Many of you readers may now think that following these advices and being so closed up and little cooperative with the law enforcement, will eventually make you look very guilty.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The fact is this: you are <u>only</u> practicing your rights as a citizen, and the law enforcement <u>cannot</u> use those rights against you as evidence in the court of law later.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Many pedophiles who are currently in prison, along with many other criminals, are there <u>only</u> because they spoke openly and cooperated fully with the law enforcement, in a naive belief that they could talk their way out of their crimes, with the intention of looking innocent and cooperative.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Those pedophiles who never spoke, and generally avoided the law enforcement as much as legally possible, are those who are outside the prisons, as we speak, and is enjoying their freedom, enjoying their life, and enjoying children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Ask yourself: on which side do you prefer to be?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The less you speak and cooperate with the law enforcement, within your rights as a citizen, and the more your lawyer speaks and cooperate with the law enforcement <u>for</u> you, the greater your chances are to escape the law and avoid serving prison time as a criminal pedophile.
