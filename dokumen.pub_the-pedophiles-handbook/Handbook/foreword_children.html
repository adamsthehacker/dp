                         Welcome to a new guide of the handbook, and our second stop on our journey to heaven. It is a pleasure to introduce our beautiful children as a scientific subject to explore and educate yourself within.

                         Before you can even start thinking about child love practice, especially practicing sex with children, it is very important to learn all there is to learn about children that is relevant for genuine pedophiles to know. There are so many things one should be careful about, and just as many things one can exploit to get close to them and their forbidden fruits.

                         Children are something <u>very</u> special. They create some very powerful feelings of love and care inside all of us. However, inside genuine pedophiles they create even <u>more</u>, and that is romantic and sexual feelings. When combining all this into <u>one</u>, you suddenly realize how much of a gift our genuine pedophilic orientation is, and how valuable children are to us.

                         Because, this unique mixture makes pedophiles the ones who get the greatest kicks out of love and sex, because it is really unique being intimate with someone who are so cute and innocent, and so erotically attractive, in the <u>same</u> time.

                         It's almost a little bit <u>too</u> much to handle!

                         This guide will give you a basic but very effective insight into the children's sexuality at their different stages in live. We will also look into their sexual, psychological and physiological development. Then we'll look into all the different personalities among children, how these affect our child love practice, and learn how to recognize common personality traits when you're about to involve yourself with several different children. And finally there's chemistry, so you'll learn what this really is and how important it is for your success and safety as an active pedophile and child lover.
