                         We are now moving over to a more positive and exciting chapter, which is about how to plan and prepare for an escape from the law enforcement <u>before</u> they arrest you.

                         Thus, if you're living in a country or region that practices hard consequences for illegal child love practice if caught, especially with insecure legal systems and less survivable prisons, you may want to consider creating an escape plan if you should ever be suspected or get caught for it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may want to do this regardless of where you live, as it can actually keep you away from the law enforcement and make you stay out of jail as a free individual if you ever get caught; and finally become an underground citizen, and a ghost of the society, with some unique excitements and advantages.

                         <br />

                         How to successfully escape from the law enforcement and live as a fugitive are two very complex subjects with lots of different variables, which really deserves their own handbook. This chapter will thus be quite basic as of now, but hopefully develop into a more complex education in the future.

                         <br />

                         A successful escape doesn't only require good planning however, it also requires <u>luck</u>. Because, there are many ways of getting caught, and some people will simply not have the opportunity to escape before they get arrested. So, this planning won't make an escape a guarantee, it will only create a potential insurance that you <u>may</u> have to use and <u>may</u> be able to successfully use if the shit hits the fan for real.

                         The first thing you must create and organize is a temporary safe location that you can move to and stay at if you ever decide to escape from the society.

                         <br />

                         Such a location will give you time to calmly think things through and review your situation, while waiting for the whole situation and mess to cool down a bit, so you can finally move on and into a new life as a fugitive and underground citizen.

                         The law enforcement will think that you're trying to run away and <u>out</u> of the area, thus dedicate a fair amount of resources on that assumption; but instead you're waiting <u>within</u> it, until it becomes much safer to actually run, while being all calm and all prepared.

                         Please note that all electronics in your fugitive kit should not be purchased in advance with a credit-card, but rather purchased anonymously as second-hand with cash payment. And never send any of these electronics in for service or repair after you've become a fugitive.

                         All this should be in a backpack, well hidden at the location. This will give you a great basis for an escape.

                         You may of course add anything you'd like having along with you on the road as a fugitive, as this can become a very long and complex road with an uncertain outcome.

                         When the law enforcement makes plans for a surprise arrest, they prefer to perform this where and when you are most vulnerable and least likely to successfully escape. Thus, they tend to pick your home at very early hours. They will then knock on your front door, usually along with their warrants, while watching the backside too, and try surprising you in your underwear, literately, while being sleepy and confused.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, hearing the doorbell and/or hard knocks on your front door at very early hours, is usually the first tell-tail of an arrest.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, home arrests may happen at any time of the day; and it might not be related to illegal child love practice either, it can just as well be about child pornography. So a great default security policy is to always check who's at your door, without being seen yourself, before taking any actions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A second tell-tail is having unknown people at your front door carrying any envelopes or papers along with them; especially if there are more than just one or two people who have surrounded your home, as they usually need backup for house searches and potential escapes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>Any</u> unknown person who comes to your door at any time of the day, may be a cop. and should thus be treated as one:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now it would be great having a <b class="h">hideout</b> in your own home, where you can hide when they finally break inside to complete the arrest and house search, which they <u>will</u> do and are allowed to with the right warrants in place.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just move silently to your secret compartment, and wait in there to see what happens during the next 10-15 minutes:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If they just ring your doorbell or knock a few times, but then leave your property after a while, you shouldn't be under arrest after all; thus you may leave your secret compartment and continue your life as normal. But still keep an eye on your front door, and look out for any people or cars that seem to monitor your home, as you can't be too careful about this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If they start to fiddle with your door handle, and eventually begin picking your lock, you will just have to embrace yourself and stay quiet in your secret compartment.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, you won't be the first one doing this. But most people who try to hide from the law enforcement inside their homes, are doing it spontaneously, and thus hide at stupid places, like under the bed or behind some props at the attic. I'm <u>now</u> talking about hiding within secret rooms or compartments that are <u>especially</u> made for this task, which aren't obvious. Then they won't find you, unless they use a sledgehammer or bulldozer to take the whole house down, having a trained architect or building engineer along with them, or using a police dog, all of which they rarely do with common arrests and house searches like these.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such a space won't just work as a hideout to stay within while they break inside your home, so you can avoid being arrested, it should also contain a <a class="set3" href="#fugitive_kit">fugitive kit</a>, unless you have it at a second safe location that you will move to later.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         House searches will take about 1-3 hours, depending on the size of the house and how much they need to confiscate.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When they're done, they will finally leave the house. But they will most likely cover your front door with a squad car, and generally monitor your home while looking for any activities. Since they didn't find you at home, they will assume that you where out, thus expect you to arrive back sometime later.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, if you choose to leave your secret compartment and move around in the house, do it as stealthy as possible; or else they may see that you're home after all, and thus come back and start tearing your home apart to find you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, it is time to silently escape from the house, and either move to a second safe location or simply initiate your new life as a fugitive and underground citizen.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Please note that they may already be searching for you within your local town or area, making it wise to wait as long as possible to escape from your house. Though, they may at any time come silently back and into your home for various reasons, making it kind of hard choosing the right moment to flee. Personally, I would've fled in the darkness of the upcoming night, like at 3:00 am, unless I knew for sure that it had been safe doing otherwise.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The main challenge with this method is to actually build a secret room or compartment to begin with, and especially doing so successfully in secrecy while sharing your home with other people, like your family. And if everybody are at home during the arrest, it will be even harder moving into that secret space without being seen. Because, such a secret space will <u>have</u> to be a secret that only <u>you</u> know about.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Another challenge is that the law enforcement may suspect that you really <u>are</u> home, from miscellaneous tell-tails, which may cause a smart agent to look for secret spaces, and do so <u>until</u> he finally finds you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're not at home when the law enforcement is braking into your home, they may surprise you when you finally come home, thus arrest you. And even if you <u>should</u> see them before they see you, it will become quite difficult and risky getting inside it afterwards without being seen, like if you need to pick up important stuff and/or a <a class="set3" href="#fugitive_kit">fugitive kit</a> that is hidden within a secret space.

                         If you lack enough experience within architecture and carpentering to build a decent secret room or compartment, there are security companies and carpenters out there who can help you build it, professionally and perfectly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Your excuse for having this built will of course be to protect yourself from burglars and crazy home invaders. And the law enforcement will most likely not know about this project, especially not by using non-local services <u>and</u> paying cash.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         The size of the compartment doesn't have to be all that big either, so it doesn't have to be a large secret room with a pool table and bar. It may only be large enough for one person to fit within, ideally with a mattress to lie down on.

                         I can't give you any manuals nor links for building such compartments, as there are too many different houses out there, and I don't want to reveal any important ideas for such to the law enforcement. But you should be able to <u>anonymously</u> research this by your own, and make it happen in one way or another.

                         Creating an abnormal exit door is also recommended, like a secret door to escape out of your home at a part of your house where it's highly unlikely for anyone to come out of. This can become important if your house becomes extensively surveyed after the raid and arrest attempt. It can even save your life if you should ever end up in a fire trap(!).

                         Having some custom and discreet alarms, like motion detector sensors and hidden cameras, may additionally aid you and give you a much better overview of the whole situation. Such equipment is actually cheap to buy at most electronics stores and very easy and convenient to use.

                         It could be wise to have a note always lying on your e.g. kitchen table that is written to a fictive character, saying that you're visiting a friend and won't come back until tomorrow. This is a simple but effective trick to make the agents less eager to search through the house to find you.

                         A hidden camp in the woods is a great safe location, and a great addition to a secret room in your home, being a nice place to hide a <a class="set3" href="#fugitive_kit">fugitive kit</a> along with even more equipment.

                         A nice and comfortable place in the woods, far away from common hiking paths and popular fishing and hunting spots, will give you a very nice place to hide within, and hide from the law enforcement, even for extended periods.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The law enforcement will less likely search for you in there, unless they have followed you through a chase, or having left an unfortunate trail behind yourself.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may setup a camouflaged tent there that blends with the environment, which can store additional survival and personal hygiene equipment, especially food and water. And if there's a lake nearby, you won't run out of water anytime soon.

                         If you generally know your way around in woods, and know how to survive there, you can stay there for a pretty long time if you want to. And If you don't know your way around in woods at all, it is very easy to learn and adapt. Why not have books there that can help you? Living in the woods is something that's inside our genes, and where our ancestors lived and survived for millions of years in the past(!).
                         
                         <br />

                         And whenever you are ready, you can both safely and conveniently leave the camp site, and start your new life as a fugitive and underground citizen. Though, the longer you wait, the safer it will become leaving the camp, as the hunt for you will gradually become colder by each day that passes by.

                         However, it may become a challenge getting there from wherever you are at when realizing that the law enforcement is coming for you. You may have to travel a certain distance, even need a car that will be very difficult to hide when arriving. And there may be lots of witnesses who see you on your way to the location. But this will depend a lot on where you live and where you're about to escape.

                         Another challenge, or should I say risk, is that someone may find your hidden camp site and mess with it. It can be fishers or hunters, or some kids. This also means that it will become a challenge to securely hide a <a class="set3" href="#fugitive_kit">fugitive kit</a> and general on-camp equipment, which ideally should be buried discreetly down and into the ground inside waterproof plastic bags.

                         And of course, if it's winter, it will become yet again challenging finding food, keeping water in a liquid state, and keeping yourself warm for longer periods. It will be generally hard moving through snow.

                         <br />
                         
                         A secret low-budget apartment, ideally located between your home and work, rented anonymously with cash by using a fake name/ID, is my last advice for a secret location.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It doesn't have to be a typical apartment either, it can be any indoor space that is for rent, whether being a little shop on a street corner or a simple storage garage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is a great alternative to a safe location in the woods, if there are less wooded areas where you live, or if you find too many disadvantages with living temporarily as a bushman.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can even be an additional safe location to either one or both of the latter. The more, the merrier.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A regular apartment will definitely be the most <u>convenient</u>: having a bed to rest or sleep on, a TV for watching local news, a computer with Internet access, a freezer full of food, a shower, and all the appliances and props a regular home has. And of course, the much needed <a class="set3" href="#fugitive_kit">fugitive kit</a> as well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A secret apartment will also make it much easier owning a secret low-budget car as well, conveniently and legally parked at or nearby the apartment itself.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now, you can <u>really</u> have a nice temporary hideout to wait at until the heat around you decreases some, so you can finally escape into a new life as a fugitive and underground citizen.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         But just as convenient and comfortable a secret apartment is, it can become equally dangerous. Because, a picture of you can end up in the news, and the one(s) you're renting from, or any other neighbor of this safe location, may recognize your face and thus report you to the law enforcement.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is also expensive renting a second apartment; and challenging doing so anonymously, especially if you're living in a small town, which will require renting an apartment further away instead, which again becomes harder getting to from wherever you may be when realizing that you're caught.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If some crooks realize that your secret apartment is rarely used, a burglary may happen, which is not good if you're hiding a large sum of money in there.

Or, asking your wife at home to do the same. They will all most likely report you to the law enforcement sooner or later when they learn that you're a <u>pedophile</u> whom have molested kids.

                         Your safe location <u>must</u> be regularly checked and maintained, so it will be all ready when you need it for real.

                         You may want to have several such location available, like all three of them; ideally with several resource storages and <a class="set3" href="#fugitive_kit">fugitive kits</a>. Then it will be much easier escaping the law enforcement during a surprise arrest, or if you generally need to escape quickly, as this will give you more options available from where you are currently located when you suddenly need to move to any of your safe locations.

                         The worst scenario for a criminal who wants to escape the law enforcement, is a surprise arrest in terms of a confrontation that leaves you with few to no escape options. Suddenly they are there, which you weren't prepared for at all, and there's nowhere to go.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The biggest mistake a criminal does in such scenarios, is to panic and then try to flee. Some just start to run in a random direction. Others jump into their cars, trying to outrun the police on the road. Unfortunately, the statistics aren't on the criminal's side in such scenarios, as most of them actually do get caught in the end. Some even hurt themselves in the process, like being bitten by police dogs, shot in the legs, or crashing their cars with very bad personal outcomes.

                         <br />
                         
                         Well, no plans what so ever have been made by the criminal, while the law enforcement agents hasn't only made plans for a potential escape, but they also hunt down criminals for their living. They got radios, dogs, choppers, and what's not, which is usually enough to handle most spontaneous flees.

                         <br />
                         
                         Not only will the odds of escape be much against you, but when they finally <u>do</u> catch you, you've just admitted indirectly that you're a real criminal, <u>while</u> becoming all locked up until your trial because of the flee risk. And of course, the attempt of fleeing <u>will</u> be used against you as evidence in court.

                         If there are no real ways of escaping, the best thing to do is to cooperate with the law enforcement fully in such situations, while staying calm and making them trust you. This will increase the chances of being let out again the same day, or get bailed. This cooperation and calmness will also strengthen your case in court, if you should end up there.

                         A failed attempt to flee may even increase the length of a potential prison sentence.

                         However, they may have enough evidence on you that makes any cooperation little to no helpful for you in the end, which makes an attempt to flee more sensible after all:

                         <br />
                         
                         If you <u>do</u> decide to flee, a challenge will be to know <u>when</u>. Most law enforcement agents don't shout out from a distance that you're arrested; they first approach you, and <u>then</u> tell, usually while grabbing a hold on you and preparing the handcuffs. Because, fleeing is exactly what they are prepared for and don't want you to do.

                         <br />
                         
                         So, the only way for you to flee is either when they approach you, and before they have grabbed a hold of you and told you that you're under arrest, or simply by jerking yourself out of their grips; and then make a run for it.

                         As soon as you take off and try to get way, the law enforcement agents will do the same thing and try catching up with you. The closer they are to you at the start of the run, the closer they will stay behind you, and the less room for mistakes you will have during the whole run.

                         A regular law enforcement agent is quite well trained, while being in a generally decent physical condition, and have most likely done this a couple of times before. However, a common police officer <u>does</u> have lots of heavy equipment hanging onto himself, and federal agents are usually in stiff and less elastic clothes, giving them all disadvantages.

                         To be able to outrun law enforcement agents, you must be in an excellent physical condition yourself, with regular running exercises. You should always have high-end running shoes on that are ideal for running in different terrains. You should always have elastic clothes on that doesn't decrease your running performance nor the abilities to easily climb and jump obstacles. The latter should be practiced on as well.

                         Don't panic, be cold and concentrated. Look where your feet will land. Breathe with long and deep breaths, not quick and shallow. Use long steps, not short. Remind yourself about the disadvantages the law enforcement agents have, which you don't have. Remind yourself that this can be accomplished, you can win, because you are <u>prepared</u>.

                         You should additionally always have a running plan, and have a running plan for each location where you move by foot on an everyday basis; like between your work office and your car, between the local mall and your car, between your home and your car, and etc. Then you'll know exactly where to run, and temporarily hide. And of course, practice these routes either by running or walking them now and then.

                         The trick is to follow a common military tactic when retreating by foot with your enemy close behind, which is running fast enough or cut a corner that lets you out of their sights for a brief moment. And then use that brief moment to hide somewhere where they can't see you. Now, they will become instantly and very confused; either continue running and disappear, or begin fooling around in the area in an attempt to find your hiding spot. While <u>you</u> is being able to rest, keep an eye on them, at least partially, and make a new go for it at the right moment. And a right moment would be when they are as far away from you as possible, or at least when turning away from you; and ideally leave in silence and stealth.

                         Always head for thick woods in country areas, or crowded locations in city areas. Within such locations you can easily hide and slip away. And you should regularly practice on running and navigating within these environments. Look for cabs standing and waiting, so you can jump into one and make the driver drive away ASAP. Also look for buses and trains standing at platforms and waiting as well, so you can jump into them right before they leave. Even consider jumping into any running car while the driver is temporarily outside it, or jumping onto the roof of a train from a bridge.

                         Your only way to successfully escape chases by foot, is to be able to run faster and longer than the ones chasing you, and be prepared to do some crazy stunts along the way.

                         If you're able to get inside your own car, or you're already in your car when they attempt to arrest you, or maybe you're able to spontaneously steal a car that's ready to go, the last option is to try outrunning them on the road.

                         Regular law enforcement cruisers are limited when it comes to street racing performances. In the US, some of them have big engines, but in the same time being horrible to handle. In the UK, some of them are really good, usually later Mitsubishi EVO models. These have both great engines and great handling, making them hard to escape from unless you've got something that's even better. Some countries have even super cars, but these are of very few. Powerful law enforcement cruisers are usually restricted to large interstate highways in large city areas. Thus, most rural areas have police cruisers with pretty standard specs.

                         The only way to get away from the law enforcement on the road, is to have a powerful car that in the same time handles curves and corners well. Having decent experience in fast driving is just as essential, especially on small and curvy roads during rain. If you've never driven fast before, and suddenly attempt doing so, even with a great sports car, you will most likely end up on your roof somewhere down the road.

                         Of course, the latest and greatest super cars have lots of electronics to aid the driver, so even a noob can drive them extremely fast and well without crashing. But these are obviously pricey. Older super cars can be almost just as great as the new ones in terms of pure performance, but they do require a lot more from the driver.

                         <b class="h">Option 1</b> is to aim for large freeways, and keep staying on them until you get rid of the blue lights and sirens. These roads are wide and straight, and allow you to conveniently pass a lot of cars at very high speeds. They are also easier to handle with less powerful cars, as most family wagons can reach pretty high speeds at such roads if you give them enough time. With powerful cars however, you can obtain some insane speeds at such roads. And they allow you to keep these speeds up and cross different states/regions. And as soon as you have left the police cruisers in the dust, you can take off and continue on smaller roads.

                         <b class="h">Option 2</b> is to go off-road, which is the most successful way of getting rid of the law enforcement on wheels. Because, very few law enforcement cruisers can handle off-road driving. Of course, this will require that you got a <u>decent</u> SUV. You may then just take off the road at almost anywhere, like straight into a cornfield or light woods, and even cross shallow rivers and etc. Even if you go slow, they still won't be able to follow you. And you don't need a brand new $200,000 Range Rover to accomplish this either, an old $1000 Blazer will do the job and leave any ordinary vehicle behind. An old Blazer will actually be much better than any budged (family) SUV anyway. So, make sure you ask around and choose the right vehicle if you're serious about off-road vehicle escapes.

                         A large and heavy SUV will also be much harder for the law enforcement cruisers to try ramming as well, and they will be hard to tip over if you drive them hard. You can even use them to smash into their cars and roadblocks at medium speeds, or temporarily take off the road to drive <u>around</u> any roadblock or obstacle of theirs, and still be able to keep on driving afterwards. And the older SUVs are actually those who can handle the most beating before they break down.

                         Always have your car filled to the brink with gas, because many law enforcement car chases that could've ended successfully for the chased ones, didn't end successfully because they ran out of gas.

                         Install a police scanner in your car, or use a portable one that you can carry with a belt clip while using ear plugs. This may give you an advantage in terms of what they plan on doing during the chase. A portable one will be extra advantageous if you ever leave your car and continue by foot.

                         Always remember to keep your doors locked, and keep your head cool during the whole chase. It is not the quantity of driving that matters, but the quality of driving; so prioritize careful driving over high speed driving, and only run at high speeds when it is safe or strictly necessary to do so.

                         The law enforcement cruisers will most likely do PIT maneuvers on your car if they get close to you; meaning that they will come up on either side of your car, align their front wheels with your back wheels, and smash into you, making your car spin out of control. As soon as you see this happening, either accelerate or brake, and keep them from aligning their cars with yours like this.

                         If you're driving at night, you can switch off you headlights; ideally use nigh vision goggles while doing so. This will make it incredibly hard for the law enforcement to keep up with you, especially if you go off road. But this is dangerous, and it is <u>way</u> more difficult driving with nigh vision goggles, unless they are stereo (3D).

                         If you got a powerful motorbike, they won't have a chance. Even their quickest cruisers can't keep up with those machines, while also being able to drive in-between cars if you ever end up in a highway queue.

                                   His trick was to buy a set of police handcuff keys on Ebay for $2.99, and always having them inside a secret part of his jeans somewhere around his back pockets.

                                   When he once was caught and arrested for a pretty serious crime, he used those keys at the right moment, and was able to run away and actually successfully escape. 
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   The funny thing is that he did it right outside the police station, and disappeared into the large city, never to be seen again.

                         Such keys can become a really cheap investment and insurance, instead of using e.g. a makeshift key or paper clip.

                         However, the agents may ransack you during the arrest, so it could be wise to hide those keys at an unusual place on your body, but still accessible while having handcuffs on.

                         Arrests do sometimes happen pretty spontaneously; like if the law enforcement suddenly gets a report about you having molested a child, which is backed up with decent evidence, they will want to arrest you at <u>once</u>.

                         The place where you are most vulnerable, and where the law enforcement <u>prefer</u> arresting you, is actually at your work; because there you will be distracted, thus easily surprised and less able to protect yourself, with less rights as a citizen, contrary to being arrested in your own home.

                                   I know about one particular instance when a school teacher, who I cannot tell too much about because of anonymity issues, actually escaped the police by using a portable police scanner that he had mounted onto himself under a sweater, and listened to through an earplug at almost all the time at work. That scanner gave him enough warning about his arrest to retreat from the school and move to a safe location.
                         
                                   <br />

                                   He actually escaped successfully, and is currently building a new life and identity for himself as a school teacher(!), and is one of several stories of sunshine when pedophiles beat the system through science and advanced creativity.

                         I've heard about other pedophiles too who've been able to escape from their work during arrests, because they could see or hear the police arriving, or was warned in various ways, which was enough to get out of the area.

                         But, the law enforcement doesn't always know where you work. They may not have access to that particular information at the particular time of the arrest, or you may have a job that isn't officially registered in any official records. Thus, they will go straight for your home address.

                         They will go straight for your home address anyway if the arrest happens outside your work hours.

                         There are special alarms that you can buy and easily install into your home, without using a security company, which will silently go off when they detect any motions. They will then call a phone number that you have programmed, and alert about the motion detection.
                         
                         <br />

                         Such an alarm could be wise to install into your home, as it will be triggered when the law enforcement breaks into it, and instantly let you know about it through your cell phone.
                         
                         <br />

                         Some of these alarms can take snapshots of the intruders, some even stream a live video to your smartphone.

                         As soon as you are noticed about the unknown house entrance, turn off your cell phone and pick out its battery, and leave straight for your safe location.

                         If you got the money, you can do what several other advanced criminals do: registering your <u>official</u> home address to an unused low-budget apartment somewhere, while your real home is either an apartment or a house that isn't registered in your name. And of course, your <u>official</u> apartment should have an alarm system as explained above, which can warn you far before they really find you.

                         Some pedophiles have the 'luxury' of knowing that they will be arrested. This can happen in various ways, but usually because they have either been confronted by civilians about sexual child abuse, been caught red handed by civilians, had sex with children whom have threatened or seems very likely to tell about it afterwards, or the pedophile has already been arrested, but is not in jail while awaiting court.

                         <br />
                         
                         Some other active pedophiles have noticed that they have been followed by cars, and have seen unknown cars parked outside their homes at various distances, which most likely are unmarked police cars trying to map their everyday routines; meaning that they are already being investigated, thus an arrest can happen at any time from that point.

                         <br />

                         These scenarios will make you highly able to escape, if that is your only solution and alternative to confronting the law. And such an escape should ideally happen in the dark and during night, and ideally by foot, so you can move to your safe location ASAP, and get there long before they arrest you.

                         Even with the slightest suspicion, always make an attempt to escape to your safe location. And from there, try investigating further what's really happening and going on.

                         Entering a new life as a fugitive will definitely become a huge change in your life, which will offer a lot of new challenges, but also some unique advantages. It will nevertheless be a much better change in your life than trying to sleep through the first night as an inmate in a tight prison cell.

                         The main challenge is to <u>survive</u> as a fugitive, as in trying to feed yourself, cloth yourself, and having a bed to sleep in underneath a roof. There are books out there about how to successfully do this, even some free guides on the Internet, which actually are interesting to read regardless.

                         The whole point about leaving the regular society as a pedophile fugitive, is <u>not</u> to become an eternal and dirty homeless, but instead <u>resurface</u> at some point in the future, at a whole different location, with a fresh identity and start.

                         Some people have actually ended up in more wealthy and comfortable life situations than the ones they left behind(!). Because, this change will offer new <u>opportunities</u>, while forcing you to think alternatively and outside the box.

                         The main advantage is <u>freedom</u>, as in living your life outside the society and below the radar of the law enforcement; which is why many people actually choose to do this willingly, even though they never where arrested in the first place.

                         Most interestingly, by living in the underground as a <u>pedophile</u> fugitive and drifter, you will be able to seduce and molest children outdoors like never before, while no one can actually trace you back to anyone nor anything if you are really careful. You will simply become a pedophile ghost that moves all around, without any home base nor any true source.

                         It all begins as soon as you leave your safe location, after having escaped the law enforcement, when you enter the underground as a ghost. Or, actually doing so all <u>willingly</u>, without having been involved with the law enforcement at all.

                         If you got the luxury of <u>time</u> before the real escape, and it is safe for you to move around some without being arrested, leaving false trails is a great thing to do before leaving.

And buy that with your credit-card, so the law enforcement will be able to see these transactions later. And it is especially important that you buy a long distance ticket to a specific place where you'll <u>never</u> travel to in the future.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Also buy some props with that same credit-card that will be somehow related to the place you are seemingly traveling to. If you're buying a ticket to a cold place, buy some warm clothes. Or vice versa. If there are lakes where you're seemingly traveling to, buy e.g. fishing equipment. And etc.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, redraw all the money from that credit-card with an ATM, and afterwards just throw away the credit-card, tickets and all gear without being seen by anyone.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The law enforcement will now think that you are one of those stupid or desperate criminals who're about to sit down on like a bus with a fishing pole, and travel to a certain location to get away from it all. They should now use a lot of resources aimed towards that particular destination, which also may include road blocks and local distributions of police drawings or pictures of you. And when they realize that the trail is cold, and that they've been set up, you will be long gone in <u>any</u> other direction; and they will loose both hope and moral.

                         If it's not safe for you to move around before you leave the society, it would be best to not <u>try</u> doing this, but rather just leave all your credit-cards behind and just initiate the escape.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may want to redraw some money, but this should be done with care and <u>before</u> you actually start your new life as a fugitive and underground citizen.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may optionally create a fake escape plan on your regular computer in a non-encrypted state, which may also send the law enforcement in the wrong direction if you ever need to escape quickly in the future.

                         Live as long as possible outside the society, while interacting with as few people as possible, ideally none.

                         For example, exploit nature and/or or live from stacked resources by eating and drinking as little as possible, while being very little active in general to save food and energy.

                         This can become lonesome, but it is important that you do this for as long as possible, or as long as you can stand.

                         The longer you stay low, the colder both your trace and case will become when the time comes to resurface, as the law enforcement will only use major resources for a limited period during their attempt to find you. And, you will less likely be recognized by other civilians if your picture has been spread all over the news.

                         You will also save most of the money that you have stacked up, so you can use them for real to resurface as a new member of the society later, and start your new life.

                         Also use this time to think about what <u>story</u> you will tell the people of the new place you will be resurfacing at, which we will come back to later in this chapter.

                         One thing you will have to do when becoming a fugitive, is to make a <u>complete</u> separation between your new life as a fugitive and your former life as a regular citizen.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         For some, this can be a hard thing to do with lots of sorrow, while for others it will end up as a blessing.

                         <br />
                         
                         This means <u>never</u> contacting <u>any</u> people whom you once knew in your former life, including your own children, wife, parents and best friends. Even though if it becomes hugely tempting to do so, just giving them a sign, <u>never</u> do it.

                         <u>Never</u> visit the same malls, medical clinics, bars, clubs, or any locations that you regularly used in your former life.

                         Do <u>not</u> take your personal laptop or cellphone along with you as a fugitive. Even with new software and SIM-cards installed, they might still be tracked somehow.

                         Do <u>not</u> use the same old patterns as you did in your former life, like buying special combinations of products and services, <u>neither</u> perform any of such activities anywhere. Such unique patterns may be picked up by the law enforcement by accident, and they will find you.
                         
                         <br />

                         Your old self will have to <u>die</u>, while your new self will be <u>reborn</u>. And your new person will have to become an <u>all</u> new person.

                         And this can become a very positive thing, because now you can become anyone you want to or once wish you where.

                         Resurfacing is all about coming back to the society again, either as a new member with a new ID, or as an exploitative ghost that will just hover around indefinitely. This will anyway become a brand new start of a brand new life.

                         There are lots of places to resurface at. But, you will most likely have to choose between a new small town or community, or a new big city environment, which should be very far away from your former and original location.

                         When resurfacing, you <u>must</u> have a story ready. You must be able to answer questions about who you are, what you do for a living, and why you're there; and you'll have to answer those questions quickly with confidence.

                         And of course, use your <b class="h">new name</b> when presenting yourself to new people, which should be easy to remember and respond to, and not related to any other persons whom you once knew in your past life.

                         My favorite story is about a man who recently became unemployed, who is traveling around and experiencing the beautiful country he's living within, while looking for a new place to settle down at and establish himself within, hopefully with a nice job and a family. He once had his own small business that recently went bankrupt; a business that corresponds with your own favorite hobby, making it easy for you to talk about that business, like if you know what you're talking about, so it becomes credible. You are just an  unfortunate guy who is unemployed and unmarried, and just wants to start a new life.
                         
                         <br />

                         Such a story will be very easy to sell, as it has very few details to remember and to get wrong. It will make you seem like an unfortunate and humble person who are willing to work hard to start all over, thus becoming easily liked and trusted.

                         The place you will tell that you're coming from, should ideally be a <u>large</u> city far away from your true origin.

                         Small communities have the advantage of being more or less cut off from the rest of the world, as they rarely focus on places and things outside their own little bubbles.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You're also more likely to gain trust there, because those people are living in a safe environment with very little to no crime at all. Thus, you will more likely find new friends or a new girlfriend there, like a single mom who haven't been with a male for years, and have 6 brats to take care of(!).

                         Jobs will be easier to find as well, without having to show any referrals; jobs that will 'pay under the table', so to speak, so no IDs nor taxes will be involved. It can be jobs at farms or at vehicle service stations.

                         Small communities are famous for their religious activities; so you may want to visit their local churches and ask if they got some work for you, while of course appearing as deeply religious. If you're lucky, you may actually be invited into a religious order, or a sect if you like, as they crave for new members, and crave to redeem and control people; which can work as an important protection and advantage for you, in the same time as gaining potential access to sweet kids.

                         <br />
                         
                         If the church doesn't have any paid work for you, ask if they got some volunteer work instead, just to keep yourself busy and be close to e.g. Jesus. This may give you some free food, and great referrals when looking for jobs elsewhere, while of course increasing the odds of meeting other people who'll like you and trust you; all of which can create important resources and opportunities to exploit into the future.

                         And as soon as you gain a local reputation of being religious, people will more easily trust you in general, even enough for some families letting you rent a room in their homes, or letting you work at their farms for some food and shelter.

                         This is <u>exactly</u> why I always recommend churches and religious orders as places for pedophiles who are on the run to seek shelter at. I've heard a few crazy stories in that regard, about pedophiles having ended up in small Heavens of protection, wealth and pleasure. Though, it usually requires some strange ways of living, with strange rules and rituals, but very worth doing, at least for a while.

                         In small towns however, all strangers will stick out and become very visible, even by the local law enforcement. And most of the residents don't trust nor appreciate drifters.

                         Use your saved money to dress and look basically decent, while renting a low-budget motel or hotel room. Stay low, and try avoiding the local law enforcement as much as possible, while not attracting too much attention towards yourself in general.

                         Small towns can become true blessings for pedophile fugitives, with lots of interesting opportunities, as long as you are <u>careful</u> and being <u>decent</u> and <u>open</u> towards people.

                         The main advantage with large communities is that it's easy to blend in there without gaining too much attention. There will be lots of people moving around, and most of them won't care about whom you are nor where you come from.
                         
                         <br />

                         Large communities, especially big cities, have hundreds of places to look for work at. It can be a gas station, cafeteria, miscellaneous corner shops, a warehouse, or any place that can offer work that 'pays under the table'. Just move from one place to another and politely ask for work, without being desperate and pushy. If they reject you, thank them for their time and move on to the next place.

                         <br />
                         
                         If there are no jobs available, revisit one of the earlier places where you where rejected, apologize for bothering them again, and offer to work for very little salary, like just enough to get one meal a day and being able to pay for the cheap room you're renting. Most workplaces like this! You may end up working very hard for very little money, but come on, you're totally free as a human being and is actually <u>surviving</u>. And if they like you as a nice and hard working guy, you may build nice referrals, or even get a promotion. And if you ever want to move on, just do that and never show up again.

                         Use your saved money to look decent and partially well dressed when looking for jobs, as it is always advantageous to appear as decent, clean and resourceful in that regard.

                         Large cities can also offer criminal jobs, like drug dealing and illegal package deliveries. But this is <u>not</u> recommended, as it can quickly lead to an arrest, and then they will <u>finally</u> get you.

                         Big cities aren't known to be very trusting, most people there either don't care about you or they don't trust you. So, it can be hard finding friends and spouses there, but of course not totally impossible:

                         Visit a few bars, as decently dressed, and you might just find yourself a beast of a woman whom you can leech on for a while. Some of them got decent money as well. This is actually a well used way for criminal men to seek food and shelter in large cities, and my number <u>one</u> recommendation.

                         Several pedophile fugitives have successfully done such leaching in large communities, and even gotten access to children in the same time.

                         Big cities tend to become very lonely and depressing places, even though there are so many people around. They're thus initially hard to survive within, and can easily eat you up and spit you out again as a dirty homeless street vagabond.

                         You really don't want to end up as a homeless street vagabond in a large city. You should really focus on jobs and earning money, or leeching on ugly females, so you have some sort of a foundation to live on. As soon as you become a homeless street vagabond, you will quickly end up at the very bottom, and it will be extremely hard to get up again.

                         If everything should fail, my best advice is to move to a part of your country where there's lots of nature that offers great resources, and a place that is as warm as possible during the whole year, especially during the winters.

                         There will be plants, berries, fruits, fishes and small animals to obtain and eat. There will be lakes to drink from and wash yourself within. And by being smart, you can now and then fresh yourself up, take on clean and decent clothes, and get out there and look for jobs and opportunities.

                         Stick to <b class="h">mother nature</b> if everything fails; she will take care of you, just like she has always done for our ancestors for millions of years in the past. You will quickly learn new things and adapt, as we humans are really good at that.

                         And always remind yourself about the fact that you will simply not be anymore <u>free</u> than you are as a pedophile fugitive. This is what true freedom really is. And it is much better to fall asleep under the stars in the forest, contrary to a small prison cell in the bottom bunk.

                         Never loose hope, and always keep your focus on resurfacing as a new and underground member of the society, and a pedophile who will continue to love and make love to sweet little children far into the future.
