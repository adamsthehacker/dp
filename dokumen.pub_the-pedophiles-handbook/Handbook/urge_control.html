                         <br />
                    
                         We like to believe that we have full control over our minds and bodies, but sometimes our active consciousness gets reduced to just a helpless witness when our human instincts suddenly take control.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Sexual urge is one of the three basic and strongest instincts within all human beings, along with hunger and security. These three instincts are so strong that they can alter our behavior significantly under special circumstances, even take full control over our vessels.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         <b class="h">Hunger</b> is our strongest basic instinct. It can override all other instincts if our survival should suddenly depend on it, and turn us into wild animals in the most extreme circumstances. Without biological fuel, we simply die.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         <b class="h">Sexual urge</b> (and needs) is our second strongest instinct. When we are well fed, it is time to think about seduction and reproduction, and start spreading our genes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This instinct can also awaken the animal within us, and make us males become very persistent, even forceful, when having a physically inferior and beautiful female within our arms while being turned on and extremely horny.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         <b class="h">Security</b> is our third strongest instinct, being dominated by hunger and sexual drive, thus the reason why so many people, and pedophiles especially, care less about their own security in the moment of being very horny.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, this instinct can easily turn us into murderers, if we, or any of our beloved ones, are being seriously threatened.
                         
                         <br>
                         &#160;
                         <br>
                    
                         <span class="continued">...</span>
                    
                         <br>
                         &#160;
                         <br>
                         
                         In modern and developed societies, most people have enough food and security, so those two instincts rarely change our normal day to day behavior any significantly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, our <b class="h">sexual urge</b> is a different story, which is exactly why this subject has its own important chapter in this handbook for pedophiles, which is <b class="h">Urge Control</b>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Well, all healthy and normal people do feel sexual urge, which is a part of our everyday lives. But most don't think about its origin and how it affects us; most don't think about all the trouble it can put us in if we lower our guards.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Urge control is therefore an overlooked and underestimated subject among most people; and for pedophiles it becomes <u>especially</u> important, to be able to stay both happy and safe.

                         <b>Human Evolution and Biology</b>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The teaching of urge control begins with a quick look at our evolution and biology, as these two subjects represent the very root of sexual urges and needs.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         What most people don't think about is that sex is the root of all life. It is all-important, because it is the reason to our very existence. Without sex, there would be no humans; and no life at all. Sex is <u>everything</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Far back in time, even long before we became humans, life wasn't as easy and convenient as it is today; all primates had to <u>really</u> struggle to stay alive. With lots of deaths and a relatively short lifespan, which also meant that most primates where fertile for only a few years on average, our ancestors had to <u>reproduce</u> to survive, and they had to reproduce a <u>lot</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Thanks to the evolution and natural selection, an <u>enormous</u> sexual drive is therefore one of several important properties for survival, which the modern human has inherited from its ancestors. An enormous sexual drive is a part of our genes, and men has the strongest sexual drive of them all.

                         In the modern human society however, this level of horniness isn't really needed for <u>our</u> survival. It is very easy to stay alive in the peaceful and developed world of today; where most people are able to calmly make plans to establish families with children, according to different wishes and life situations.

                         But, we are still just as horny as our ancestors where over a million years ago, causing various challenges and problems for a lot of males in <u>our</u> society; and pedophiles especially, who got a different and complicated sexual orientation, which is both difficult to handle and highly illegal to practice.

                         Our sexuality is actually all about sexual needs, and satisfying those needs on a regular basis.

                         All normal human beings need sex and orgasms to function properly, something that is an important part of our lives that we all are forced to live with and handle.

                         The <u>way</u> we have sex also affects our sex needs. The more hot and rewarding our sexual activities are, the more satisfied and happy we become. So, it's important to make sure that your sexuality becomes as much rewarding as possible, by experiencing as exiting orgasms as possible, or else you may end up sexually frustrated and never fully satisfied.

                         However, sexual needs vary a lot between humans. Like, the average male has a need for ejaculation 3-7 times a week. While, the average female has a need for masturbation or sex 1-2 times a week. And, some people go above this average, while others below.

                         Some people have an asexual disorder, meaning that they simply have very little to no sexual needs at all. It may sound strange, but they actually don't suffer from it. Of course, for teleiophiles who are in adult relationships, this can cause marital problems. But, it is eventually about not having any needs, so they do other stuff instead, and usually stay happy.

                         Others have a hyper-sexuality disorder, better known as nymphomania, meaning that their sexual activity goes far above the average needs. And this can go so far that some people cannot function properly in the society. Some can't concentrate on school nor work, while others turn into sex addicts and even serial rapists. A former patient of mine had to masturbate at least 14 times every single day to function properly; 12 times during day and 2 times during night(!).

                         Human males are the horniest creatures on earth, which I guess isn't much of a surprise for most. The average human male is capable of reproducing at <u>any</u> given time, thanks to his continuous and high production of semen that never stops after puberty, which is that evolutionary advantage and heritage from his male ancestors.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Males aren't just <u>capable</u> of reproducing at any given time, but they also have a strong need to do that. This makes most men horny almost all the time, everyday.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It's important to learn that the basis for this continuous capability and horniness, originates from our semen. It is our very semen production and storage that control our <u>libido</u>, which is a fancy word for sexual drive and horniness.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If we take a closer look at our semen, it is a complex fluid that consists of many different elements, each element having an important function in the reproduction system.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         To simplify things, semen consists of two main ingredients: <b class="h">sperm cells</b> and <b class="h">nutrition fluids</b>. Both get mixed together to become the substance that we call semen. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The sperm cells exist and swim inside this nutrition to stay alive for a long enough period to eventually enter a female egg, after a successful sexual intercourse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All the ingredients that make up the semen are <u>continuously</u> produced inside our bodies in different organs around the genital area, the sperm cells being produced in the testicles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         What really controls the male sexual urge is thus the need to release semen, which is continuously under production and stored up inside ourselves. The semen needs to be fresh to be fertile, as the sperm cells have a limited lifespan, thus the body needs to regularly release semen so it always has a storage of fresh and fertile semen ready to ejaculate.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         As the storage of semen increases, the testosterone level also increases. Testosterone is a hormone and yet another component of controlling our sexual urge, as it makes us horny and sexually aggressive. So, the more semen we males store up over time, as in suppressing our sexuality, the more horny, motivated and aggressive we become to perform sexual activities, ideally with a sexually attractive partner. This is to release mature semen, <u>and</u> make room for new semen that is still and continuously under production inside us.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This motivation can become so strong that it blurs our intelligence and logical thinking, making us easily do things that we otherwise would've thought twice about doing.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         After having released our semen, the testosterone level decreases, and we finally calm down and become smarter and more careful again.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Do you remember from the <b class="h">Challenges</b> chapter, how important it is to have intense ejaculations to give us a greater feeling of pleasure and a less feeling of frustration, especially in the long run?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, the hotter the sexual activity, the more semen will be released during the ejaculation, thus the lower the testosterone level will become afterwards, and the more satisfied and least frustrated we will feel in the end.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, a boring jerkoff in a cold shower will release less semen, thus keep the testosterone level still high, making us feel less satisfied and more frustrated in the end. 
                         
                         <br />

                         But, ejaculating into the mouth of a sweet elementary school first-grader for the first time, will release a <u>huge</u> amount of semen, almost like a pump action shotgun, which will lower the testosterone level to a minimum, and give us the greatest drug and feeling of satisfaction ever; while totally eliminating <u>any</u> sexual frustration you might have had in advance.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         As you've already learned, mother nature <u>rewards</u> those who do the hottest sexual activities, and <u>punish</u> those who don't.

                         Male sexuality is generally very straightforward and uncomplicated, not to mention very predictable. So luckily for us, it really is quite easy to understand, and thus control. However, it will still require some self-discipline.

                         Female sexuality is kind of a paradox in this regard: it is initially much more complicated and much less straightforward than male sexuality; but in regards to pedophilia, it is actually way more simpler and less critical.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Female sexual urges are primarily driven by their menstrual cycles, as the females will become more horny in general during their monthly periods when they are most receivable for fertilization. But, it is also driven by various secondary factors, which are mostly related to social relationships and other factors of such. Female urges are anyway far less active and aggressive, giving female pedophiles a lot more initial control over their sexual urges towards children.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Female sexuality is more located between their ears rather than between their legs. They have a way more sophisticated and controlled sexuality, making them far better able to handle their sexual urges than men do, which is why female sexuality and urge control don't need the same attention.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These are the very reasons why you see far less female pedophiles being caught and sent to prison.

                         Another paradox here is the society's view on female pedophiles: most people think that female pedophilia is next to non-existent, and that most females can be trusted with children while most men cannot. In reality however, there are just as many female pedophiles as there are male pedophiles; with no scientific evidence to suggest otherwise.

                         In a military context, male pedophiles are like the infantry that attacks in the open and can be heard from a mile away; females pedophiles are like the special forces, slitting one throat after another, silently from behind, all covered, all silent, and all stealthy and blended with the environment.

                         With their easy access to children, enormous overall trust, and a sophisticated and controlled sexuality, the female pedophiles are actually the most 'dangerous' of them all.

                         Now we get to the actual urge control part, which will be a very important section for those who want to gain control over their sexuality as pedophiles.

                         However, urge control is mostly relevant for pedophile males, as the females do rarely share the male's continuously strong and aggressive sexuality. But females may still get something useful out of the following information, thus no female reader should skip this part.

                         Within human psychology, sexual abeyance is a term that describes suppressed sexual needs, either partially or fully, which means less to no sex and ejaculations.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This can happen either non-intentionally or intentionally:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Non-intentionally, as in e.g. being occupied with hard work over a certain amount of time, or finding yourself in a situation or an environment that takes away your natural sex or masturbation cycle. Or, that you have above normal sexual needs that are not being completely fulfilled over time.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Intentionally, as in doing it for a certain purpose or plan.

                         Sexual abeyance will normally cause an increasing sexual urge with time, which will alter our emotions, behavior and decision making, with both negative and positive outcomes:

                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">Negative Consequences</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The main symptom of sexual abeyance is an above normal thinking (and visualization) of children within your preference. This usually leads to a lot of sexual fantasies, which eventually will be next to impossible to get out of your head. This can make it hard for you to concentrate on other things, like your work, and create a large general disturbance in your life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         When you see a child, whether being in real life or in a picture, you will feel an instant and enormous attraction towards it, like if an electric spark goes off inside of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         An immediate frustration is usually followed by such attractions when being in a sexual abeyance state, because of not being able to act on them. And this is when many pedophiles turn to hard child pornography in pure frustration, and start thinking about ways to molest children.
                         
                         <br />

                         Those who are less empathic by nature, may even start fantasizing about assault rapes and kidnappings.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Regular erections and leakages of lubricant fluids from the genitals is also common, especially related to seeing and/or fantasizing about children. And the genitals will be much more sensitive to physical touches.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Getting erections in non-suitable situations, like on the beach or when having children on your lap in public, is also a common effect.
                         
                         <br />

                         A light aching pain in the genital area is also very common when several days has passed by since your last ejaculation, in the same time as becoming easily irritable and restless.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you're interacting with children in your life, your behavior towards them will change significantly. You will become above normal motivated to be close to them, touch them, smell them, kiss them, care for them, and love them.
                         
                         <br />

                         <b class="h">Most importantly</b>, your decision making will also be altered in a way that makes you less careful and more sexually aggressive towards children. Thus if you're extremely horny, you may end up doing things with children that you normally wouldn't have done; which can lead to deep regrets later, even unrepairable damages for both yourself and the children in question.

                         Pedophile teen males are <u>especially</u> in the danger zone in this regard. Teenagers are capable of doing irrational things <u>regardless</u>, because of their lacking abilities to judge dangerous situations. If you then add wild hormones and super horniness, things can quickly lead to a disaster. Many have actually ended up badly molesting or even raping children during intimate situations and play, simply because they couldn't control themselves. And thus, ended up in very bad situations with their families and the law enforcement, many of which ending up in harsh prisons to serve hard time.

                         Sexual abeyance <u>does</u> have positive consequences too, which can be used as tools to practice your pedophilia in several interesting ways, making it more hot and rewarding.
                         
                         <br />

                         It will generally make you much hornier than usual, and thus give you arousals and orgasms much faster and easier than usual. This can be exploited to e.g. making it much easier to come into your pants by simply cuddling with a little sweetie on your lap, optionally while waggling the kid some or masturbating yourself by rubbing your penis either from outside your pants or through its pockets. Though, such sessions may become quite intense, causing you to breathe and shiver hard, thus risk scaring the child at various levels.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you really know what you are doing, or you just want to take a chance, you may exploit sexual abeyance to become more <u>brave</u>, to make it easier to seduce a child for the first time:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most pedophiles struggle with that first barrier, so they usually pull back in the last second, but regretting afterwards that they didn't do anything. By being more horny than usual, in the same time as thinking less rationally, this can actually make your first sexual seduction of a child go much easier.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But this can also backfire; as it can easily make you push things too far, too quickly, making you regret your <u>actions</u> instead, while also risk hurting the child. Therefore, this requires experience and preparations in advance.

                         Total sexual abeyance over limited periods can increase your happiness, creativity and motivation. It has been suggested, especially by Freud, that sexual urge and drive is a kind of energy that can be channelized into different things in life. Sexual energy can be expressed through art and literature, and the love for children and life itself. The basis for this increased energy, is that mother nature wants you to get up and find yourself a mate and lover, because you have an above normal amount of semen stored up inside yourself. And you need to be happy, creative and motivated to do that.

                         When practicing a total sexual abeyance for a long enough time, you may eventually manage a so called non-touch ejaculation. This means the ability to actually ejaculate without touching your penis, simply by being very horny while watching children, whether being pictures, videos or a playground. However, it requires lots of practice and concentration to be achieved, and may become frightfully hot. And of course, this will <u>also</u> make it much easier to come into your pants while cuddling with children in general.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                         
                         
                         It will generally feel great having a much more sexual focus on children, and be able to much easier fantasize about them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The more prolonged and unsatisfied your sexuality becomes during such abeyance, the more harder and intense your final orgasm becomes, adding additional excitement and satisfaction, while giving you something to look forward to.

                         Not to mention, you will be able to ejaculate several times during just a few hours after that first explosion.

                         Sexual hyperactivity is yet another term within psychology, being the very opposite of sexual abeyance. In other words: practicing an above normal rate of sex and ejaculations.

                         This is an intentional practice that is done either because it simply feels good to masturbate as much as possible, or because there are special intentions or plans behind; all of which with both positive and negative consequences.

                         Your sexual interest for children will drop to a very safe and comfortable level, making it very safe and comfortable being around them. This is why it is a often used therapy among both conservative pedophiles and convicted sex offenders; simply because it works so well.

                         <br />

                         You will become very careful and rational when interacting with children, especially when being alone with them. The frustration of being a pedophile will also drop to a very low and comfortable level; most experience zero frustrations.

                         This practice is probably the most important one for teen males, especially those with younger siblings crawling all over them all the time. This can actually make the difference between imprisonment and freedom for those who are in less control of their own sexuality.

                         It will also help all males and females with hyper-sexuality disorders, making their lives way more comfortable.

                         Those who have <u>decided</u> to have sex with children will also benefit from this sexual hyperactivity practice; especially the newbies, as they will then stay very calm and rational during sexual activities, making things very safe and comfortable for both themselves and their little sweetie pies.

                         It will generally free up much of space in your head for other things than sexual urges. These things can actually be related to children, as in non-sexual friendships and activities, like general play, burgers at McDonald's, cinema visits, baseball matches, and etc. Pedophilia isn't just about sex!

                         There aren't that many negative consequences to over-masturbation, but it still does affect you in some ways. For <u>some</u> pedophiles, it becomes a negative experience.

                         When masturbating more than your normal and average rate, each masturbation will become weak and less exciting, with less semen per ejaculation. And the biological rewards for each ejaculation becomes lesser.

                         Even though over-masturbation is totally harmless, except for muscle cramps maybe, it can still lead to less motivation and energy to life itself. Some patients have actually reported mental depressions as a result of over-masturbation.

                         If you one day end up in a surprising and ideal sexual situation with a child, it won't become all that exciting nor rewarding. It may even be hard to come at all. This can ruin your very first sexual experience with a child; which would've been very sad.

                         However, this term is actually misleading; it has nothing to do with castration in the traditional sense, but all to do with <u>temporarily</u> disabling your reproduction system with <u>medicine</u>.

                         This medicine is usually injected with a needle, in regular intervals, to keep your reproduction system shut down for as long as the medication and treatment lasts.

                         Shutting down your sexuality, means that you'll be reducing the production of semen and testosterone, and thus reducing your whole sexual drive and urges down to an almost halt.

                         Chemical castration is extremely rare for average people and pedophiles to do, <u>unless</u> they're suffering from the worst sort of nymphomania out there. Only <u>then</u> will this medical procedure make sense, as it can differ between being close to invalid and actually functioning as a normal person in life; and/or differ between imprisonment and freedom.

                         This is <u>usually</u> an offer to sentenced pedophiles, as a part of a certain prison therapy program and/or an early release. Some pedophile convicts are actually forced to choose between chemical castration and a lifetime in prison. This can also be offered to general rapists. So, many sex offender inmates <u>do</u> take this offer to get as quickly out of prison as possible.

                         By having your sexuality shut down next to completely, you will become a pretty much asexual individual with very little to no desire for sexual activities. If your sexuality is a huge problem, while having next to none self-discipline, this may be the only way to either live a normal life or get out of prison.

                         An important note that you all should be aware off, is that chemical castration will switch off your sexual urge and drive, <u>but</u> it won't switch off your sexual orientation and general interest for children and being close to them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Most pedophiles who have gone through such treatments have reported back that their interest for children didn't decrease any. Even though they didn't feel much of sexual urges anymore, they still felt an urge to be close to children, cuddle with them, kiss them, sleep beside them, and touch them. Some even felt an urge to feel and lick their genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, this treatment is, in my humble opinion, less effective. It can causes a lot of discomfort and harm for a genuine pedophile, who in the end will <u>still</u> fall in love with children and want to be close to them. It will cause more harm than solving problems, unless you're one of those few exceptions who feel that you don't have any other choices available.

                         This is why I recommend against it to patients and all others, and instead recommend practicing a sexual hyperactivity that you can control all by <u>yourself</u>, with no harmful side effects.

                         As you can see from this chapter, the human sexuality, especially male sexuality, is a very strong drive that creates very strong sexual urges among most of us.

                         The male sexuality is like a nuclear power plant: don't keep it too hot, or else it can melt down to a nuclear disaster. Neither keep it too cold, or else it will shut down. Try finding that sweet spot and middle way in your everyday life, and tweak it in either direction to tune your sexuality in regards to your current situation, environment and intentions.

                         In other words, don't masturbate too little, or else you will end up being very horny, which may alter your emotions and behavior in a negative way. Neither masturbate too much, or else you may miss out on exiting sexual releases and internal rewards; even risk motivation-loss and depression.

                         Those of you who are very concerned about your sexual urge and control, should masturbate more than average to keep your head cold and sexuality in control; especially when being (regularly) close to and intimate with children.

                         You may also consider masturbating one or two times before seducing a child for the first time, as it will make you very calm and much better able to handle potential rejections. This will make the child feel safe and secure, and thus motivated to keep your secrets and play with you again at a later time.

                         Young male pedophiles, especially teenagers, should take the latter advices seriously, as they sometimes can make the difference between freedom and jail.

                         Those of you who have very good control of your sexuality, especially adults with experience, may want to decrease your rate of masturbation to gain some of the advantages of sexual abeyance and great horniness.
