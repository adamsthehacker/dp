                         Child sexuality is one of the most controversial and tabooed subjects in the average human society. Even today, in modern, well-educated and scientific times, it is <u>still</u> a taboo.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Child sexuality is also considered as most parent's nightmare, in terms of not knowing how to handle it. They usually become upset when their children behave sexually, making the children feel ashamed, which can cause severe damages to a child's sexual development, and sexuality as a whole.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The fact is that all healthy children <u>are</u> sexually active, which <u>is</u> perfectyl normal. They are sexually active all the way from birth and their very first gasp of breath, and it stays with all of us until we die of old age.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When I say sexually active, I mean that they are all capable of feeling and enjoying sex just as any adult person is. They can feel sexual arousal and stimuli. They can enjoy sex and begin breathing faster and deeper while being sexually stimulated. They can reach climaxes during sexual stimuli, as in strong and powerful orgasms, which afterwards make them feel relived and happy. And all this can happen with all healthy children of either gender and all ages.

                         Most children girls will even become wet when they become aroused or get stimulated, even as babies and toddlers, and be capable of getting multi-orgasms during <u>one</u> session.

                         Most kids masturbate regularly, and have their own sex lives. Some start masturbating when they're babies, but most have began masturbating fully within the age of 4; girls as boys.

                         Babies usually masturbate themselves during diaper change, after having accidentally discovered their genitals. Some parents have even witnessed that their babies have gotten orgasms during such masturbations.

                         Most toddlers are masturbating themselves when being free of their diapers, either during diaper change, potty training or when finally being fully potty trained and diaper-free. They may also rub themselves towards various large objects to stimulate their genitals, like cushions and teddy bears, even rub themselves towards <u>adults</u> whom they love and trust.

                         Most children from preschool age and beyond play more advanced sexual games both on their own and with others, while additionally being especially curious about the highly forbidden <u>adult</u> genitalia, a curiosity that continues throughout childhood.

                         At the beginning of elementary school, children girls begin to feel an urge to penetrate themselves, and usually start exploring vaginal penetrations with various object insertions, usually toys from their pinkish and girlish bedrooms.
                         
                         <br />

                         Both genders enjoy experimenting with anal fiddle and insertions too, all the way from toddlerhood and on.

                         Not like all the freaking time of course, but when they feel like or having an urge to do it; just like adults do.

                         As you may already see, there are obviously several ways to <u>exploit</u> the children's natural and common sexual curiosity and behavior, to initiate sexual activities and relationships with them, which this handbook will thoroughly teach you when we much later get much further and deeper into it.

                         Well, this is extremely hot for most pedophiles to learn about, especially if you didn't knew any of this in advance. I can remember how excited I became myself when I began my sexology studies, and child sexuality especially.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, this is a very hard and strong meal to swallow and digest for most anti-pedophiles and law enforcement agents, who usually claim that this is not true. So will most religious people claim as well. But claiming that this isn't true, is just like claiming that the earth is flat. They will need to start reading books and start educating themselves within child sexuality to become enlightened. The earth is actually round, and this <u>round</u> earth inhabits <u>horny</u> and healthy <u>children</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But, you got to wonder though, even as genuine pedophiles, why are kids so sexually active, when not being reproductive?

                         Well, this question leads us to the first section of this chapter, which is yet again a visit into the human evolution:
                         
                         <br />

                         All children go through a very long development process, and this process is all about learning how to become adults and independent human beings. Children girls begin as early as toddlers to play with dolls, and play house. Children boys begin at the same age fighting and playing with swords, and building and repairing various structures. These roles may overlap with some children, even change totally. The bottom line is that they're all simply practicing on adulthood.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, the same goes for their sexuality: they feel a natural urge to explore it, and they enjoy doing that because it feels nice. They need to learn about sex, learn how their genitals work, learn how to stimulate themselves, learn how to handle orgasms, and so forth. And eventually, they will feel an urge to explore others, so they will also learn how to interact sexually with other humans; and especially learn about opposite gender genitals, how <u>they</u> work, and how to stimulate <u>them</u>.

                         Whether they're building Lego or exploring a large adult genital for the first time, their motivation and joy of doing either, is a part of the human evolution: it is evolutionary advantageous for children to start as early as possible practicing on things that will become important for their survival when they finally become independent.

                         And regards to sex, that is actually one of the most <u>important</u> parts and functions of nature, because it is the reason to why we are here to begin with; which is exactly why sex and sexual exploration is such an important and big part of childhood, beginning all the way from day <u>1</u>, while they lie there on their changing mats like cute little dolls, and explore their own bodies with great commitment.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         They will first learn that their genitals are special and that they give them a certain feeling inside when stimulating them physically. Sooner or later they will experience their very first orgasm, and from there learn how to control their sexuality and orgasms. They will eventually begin exploring other children, or adults for that matter, and finally start exploring penetrations and sexual intercourses.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The most interesting thing about this development and learning process, which is <u>especially</u> important for all pedophiles to learn, is that most children tend to show a natural sexual interest in <u>adults</u> during preschool and early elementary school age.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some will thus act sexually seductive towards adults!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is because adults are more experienced than other children, and are thus way more valuable during this learning process. Of course, it has <u>also</u> something to do with adult genitalia being so hidden and forbidden in our culture.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It has been suggested by underground researchers that sexual relationships between children and adults are natural and evolutionary advantageous. The adult gets sexually stimulated and satisfied, the child learns important things about sex, and they both create very special bonds that make them even closer; which in the end motivates the adult to further love and protect the child, thus becoming yet another evolutionary advantage for the child's actual survival.

                         So, now you know that children are sexually active from birth, and they can become extremely horny and get orgasms, even multiple orgasms within the right circumstances. They act seductively by nature, even towards <u>adults</u> whom they love and trust fully.

                         There are some significant differences between children girls and boys when it comes to their orgasm capabilities and sexual development, which of course is important to learn:
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most know that all healthy and sexually mature boys produce semen, and ejaculate it during orgasms. But, prepubescent and sexually immature boys don't produce any semen, thus being incapable of ejaculating any.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, where does this leave their orgasm capabilities?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, prepubescent boys are still capable of getting orgasms, but these orgasms are referred to as <b class="h">dry</b>, since they can't ejaculate any seminal fluids yet. They are also capable of getting hard erections, by arousal, all the way from their birth.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Seminal fluids will usually not appear before they approach puberty, which is approximately between the ages of 8 to 12. Their seminal fluids may not contain any sperm cells to begin with, thus appear quite clear and colorless.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The girls sexuality work pretty much the same as the boys, except for that ejaculation part obviously. This means that both genders share the same great sexual interest along with arousal and orgasm capabilities, all the way from birth.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, the girls have a way wetter sexuality than the boys. The boys are usually pretty dry all the way until puberty, when their testosterone levels get high enough to trigger their internal sex organs to produce precum and seminal fluids.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The girls are thus capable of becoming quite wet during sexual arousal and genital stimulations, which is their natural vaginal lubrication fluid, all the way from birth. And this wetness even increases during orgasms.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I've heard several reports from nepiophiles who have come close to <u>drink</u> toddler pussy juice through long oral stimulation, while the little tot sluts have gotten multiple orgasms.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is unclear why little girls get so wet such young, but it obviously has some sort of evolutionary advantage; not to mention an advantage when you're about to penetrate them.

                         Another significant difference between kiddie girls and boys, regarding their sexuality, is that girls are usually a couple of years ahead of the boys as in pure sexual development.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Children girls usually start at early toddlerhood with real self-explorations and true masturbations, while the boys usually start doing this at late toddlerhood or early preschool.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The girls will switch their sexual interest towards others at late toddlerhood and early preschool, while most boys start doing that at late preschool or early elementary school.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This also regards puberty itself, as girls usually enter it between 9 and 11, while boys enter it between 11 and 13.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, all this differs a lot from child to child. This is just the average estimate among average children.

                         As if it wasn't enough that children are capable of becoming aroused and get multiple orgasms all the way from their birth, it almost becomes a little bit too much when I now add that children actually have sexual <u>needs</u> as well, just like us sexually mature have. Incredibly as it is, they <u>crave</u> for sex!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So yes, children <u>have</u> sexual needs. However, the <u>basis</u> for their needs is quite different from us sexually mature:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If we start with us sexually mature, <u>our</u> needs are based on the hormone Testosterone, as we've already been into in the <a class="set3" href="urge_control.html#sexual_needs" target="_blank">Urge&#160;Control</a> chapter of this handbook, which regards both males and females. The testosterone levels within males increases along with our semen storage, making us more horny and sexually aggressive if our semen storage fills up. The testosterone levels within females increases according to their menstrual cycles, and when they're most fertile during this cycle. It can also increase within both males and females when being sexually triggered by e.g. touch and romance.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Young teen males and females who've just entered puberty are even more hornier than any adult will ever be, because their hormone balance is way off during this challenging period and transition into adulthood.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Puberty is actually triggered by the level of Testosterone within humans, meaning that prepubescent children normally have much lower Testosterone levels than youths and adults.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Since <u>Testosterone</u> is a part of puberty and adult sex drive, where does this leave the prepubescents and young kiddies? What makes these little sweeties horny?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>Their</u> primary sex drive is mostly based on <b class="h">sexual curiosity</b>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The children brains are simply hardwired for strong sexual curiosity, and this curiosity motivates them to peek at and explore their own genitals, <u>and</u> the genitals of others.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And then, a chain reaction happens: their sexual curiosity motivates them to touch themselves, which feels good and sexually arousing, which again motivates them to masturbate, which finally gives them great pleasures and orgasms.
                         
                         <br />

                         And, as soon as they learn how to achieve orgasms, they will attempt to achieve it a lot, especially little girls.
                         
                         <br />

                         Prepubescent girls seem to be more sexually active and aggressive than prepubescent boys, on average, but does of course vary some from child to child.
                        
                         <br />

                         Kiddie orgasms can also be triggered by adults, which will gain the same end result, but way more efficiently.

                         I'll have to warn you now, because this is only getting <u>hotter</u>:
                         
                         <br />

                         Their curiosity based sexual needs doesn't only make them turn to their own genitals for exploration and touching, but also the genitals of others. And since adult genitalia is an especially restricted area for these horny little sweeties, that area is the <u>precise</u> area they aim to explore, sooner or later.
                         
                         <br />

                         Thus, most children girls and boys have a high motivation to explore and touch adult genitalia, which will really stimulate their sexual needs, while also arousing them. It's not an uncommon phenomena that young girls get wet by touching and playing with adult male genitals for the first time.

                         So, if you do things right as a pedophile, as this handbook will teach you much later, this motivation of theirs may even cause them to <u>enjoy</u> licking and sucking your penis, even enjoy cumshots into their mouths. Because, it satisfies their <u>curiosity</u>, thus satisfies their basic sexual <u>needs</u>.

                         A child's sexual <u>curiosity</u> goes like a bell curve through its childhood; it slowly increases to an insane level that peaks around 4-8 years of age, and from there decreases slowly and down to a normal level towards adulthood, when Testosterone based sexual needs take over for their earlier curiosity based sexual needs.

                         This means that most elementary school first-graders have insane sexual needs, in the name of curiosity, thus being the easiest ones for pedophiles to seduce sexually.

                         Even though little girls and little boys have some differences regarding orgasms and development, all healthy children share the same enormous curiosity for sex regardless, making them not so different in the end. They all have in common that they love sexual explorations and stimuli, especially with adults and <u>their</u> huge and forbidden genitalia.

                         Children orgasms aren't guaranteed to happen with all kids. Some will come by just cuddling on your lap with clothes on, while other won't come at all no matter what you do with them. But, the majority of healthy children <u>will</u> get one eventually, when things are done right (according to this handbook).

                         Their sexual needs vary as well; some children are extremely sexually focused, and want to be licked to orgasms and suck adult males all day long, making you come in buckets if you find the right child; while other children won't even bother exploring sex at all, and even be very difficult to trigger. Most children will find themselves somewhere between these two extreme ends, meaning that most of them are very sexually active, and love sexual explorations and play.

                         Most kids love sex, and they are waiting for you to seduce them! When you have finished reading this handbook, you will have all the tools needed to <u>exploit</u> their highly active and interesting sexuality, and their sexual curiosity and needs.
