                         Evidence is a potential problem for all pedophiles who practice illegal child love, especially for those unfortunate few who get reported to the law enforcement.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Cops <u>love</u> evidence; it makes it so much easier for them to get an arrest order on a reported pedophile, and build a case against him. It will also make it much easier for them to get a confession from a pedophile during the interrogations, and make it much harder for the pedophile to keep on denying the charges being brought against him. And if the evidence is strong enough, they are more likely to keep the pedophile arrested in jail until his trial, and additionally increase any bail.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The <u>court</u> also loves evidence; it helps the prosecutors and judges to send pedophiles to prisons as quickly as possible, for the longest times possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, if the cops <u>lack</u> evidence against a reported pedophile, the tables will suddenly turn, regardless of what crimes having been reported and committed:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         They can still take a reported pedophile in for interrogation, but they can't lock him up nor keep him there. He can leave the interrogation and police station whenever he pleases.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the cops <u>choose</u> to arrest the pedophile, even though they lack any decent evidence, the prosecutors in court can still reject the case based on that evidence lack, leaving the law enforcement totally helpless.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And the pedophile goes free, even when he actually did all the crimes he was charged with. He won, and he can continue being a free person, continue practicing illegal child love with children, and continue living his life to the fullest extent.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most law enforcement agencies and court systems in the developed world rely <u>heavily</u> on physical evidence when charging and building cases against criminals; even though if it is obvious that you did the accused crimes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is therefore highly recommended that all pedophiles think <u>thoroughly</u> about evidence during illegal child love practice, and make sure that it becomes as hard as possible to get arrested and prosecuted by the court, by leaving as little evidence behind your actions as possible.
                                                                                                    
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I've created a set of sections within this chapter, all of which will help you prevent (as much as possible) leaving evidence behind your illegal child love practice, without reducing the overall pleasure and experience too much.

                         DNA stands for <b class="h">Deoxyribonucleic acid</b>, and is a molecule that contains genetic code. This genetic code controls all the biological properties of all living organisms.
                         
                         <br />

                         If this is difficult to understand, just think of DNA as a code that basically decides how we look and function, just like a <u>blueprint</u> decides how a mechanical device looks and functions. And since every human being is pretty unique, this code is therefore also pretty unique. which gives all of us unique codes, almost like unique serial numbers.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This DNA molecule and its unique code consist within every single cell of our bodies. And if you then think about the fact that our bodies are actually <u>built</u> by cells, it should become very clear how easy it is to leave our unique DNA code behind, even when not thinking about it: when dead hair from your head fall off, when you spit used gums or spit in general, when skin cells and sweat from your hands are left on objects you touch and handle, among several other samples.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Since we pedophiles enjoy having sex with children, which involves kissing, licking, precum and ejaculation of semen, all of which contain our unique DNA code, we can very easily leave that unique code behind our illegal child love sessions. We can leave it onto or within the children, onto any belonging of the children, and onto the actual 'crime scene'.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If your illegal child love practice should ever be reported to the law enforcement, crime scene investigators can easily investigate and swab the child, its belongings, or any prop on the scene, and thus obtain your unique DNA code that you left behind. From there they can swab <u>you</u> to make a direct compare, and prove that you did the accused crime with an odds of 1 to 300,000,000,000; which basically means that you're all screwed.

                         DNA proofs are the most certain proofs there are, which cannot be explained away in any interrogation nor any court.

                         The best countermeasure to DNA evidence threats is simply to <u>not</u> leave any DNA behind your illegal child love practice.

                         This is obviously not easy, but fully possible if you're willing to go that extra mile to make certain that they can't scientifically prove any sexual abuse, which will make it very hard for most court systems worldwide to send you to prison.

                         An ejaculation can come fast and unexpectedly, even though you think you got it under control. As soon as a child puts its small and cold hands around your penis, and begin squeezing it, even the best of us can come pretty quickly. And before you know it, semen is dripping down from the child's face, who looks at you with two big and shocked eyes. Or, you shoot it all over the child's clothes and belongings.

                         Surprise ejaculation is a common problem for newbies, and first-timers especially. But it can happen to <u>anyone</u>, really.

                         The best option here is to use a condom. The child can then study and play with your cock, or you can masturbate yourself while looking at or being close to the child, and all your semen can be safely ejaculated at any time. This will also give you that extra comfort, knowing that you can come at any time without leaving any evidence behind, neither freak the child out if this is your first time exploring sex together.

                         However, a condom will create a rubber barrier between your penis and the child, thus reduce the sexual sensation both physically and mentally, which is why so many pedophiles refuse to use condoms.

                         If you insist on <u>not</u> using condoms during child love practice, treat your penis as if it was a loaded rifle; be careful where you point it towards, so you don't shot anyone by mistake. Also be careful where you shoot in general; try not to hit any textile fabrics, try hitting hard surfaces that can be easily wiped off afterwards. Optionally, have some tissues in your pocket that you can carefully ejaculate into.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may also strap a condom only onto the end of your penis, and tie a rubber band around it to make it stick. And then have the rest of your penis exposed to those small and cold hands that can safely explore and squeeze it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you have condom-free sexual intercourses with children, whether being oral, vaginal or rectal, DNA evidence can be easily obtained later; though, only within a certain time frame:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The mouth and vagina are self-cleansing, so DNA evidence will only stay in those environments for a limited time. And most DNA evidence left in the child's rectum will all be gone as soon as the child poops. The same goes for the child's skin and clothes: they will eventually be washed, thus all DNA will be all gone from there as well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The only places where your DNA will stay indefinitely, are at objects that are rarely to never washed, like on certain belongings of the child or any props at your crime scenes, especially testicle fabrics that dries and stores semen.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Semen is so important to be so careful about, as it <u>really</u> proves that you have molested a child sexually; because semen can only come from a sexual ejaculation, and your DNA can only come from you.

                         Many pedophiles are aware about semen, and is thorough about not leaving any behind their sexual activities with kids. But most of them don't think about the next two threats, which are saliva from their mouths and hair from their genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you kiss children at any part of their bodies, you will leave your saliva behind. Leaving your saliva on a child's face isn't initially dangerous, as that's a pretty common part of a child for adults to kiss. But leaving it on a child's arms, tummy or legs is quite unusual, and can be used against you later as circumstantial evidence. And leaving it near or onto a child's genitals or bum, will prove sexual molestation <u>directly</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is because your saliva is pretty much the same thing as your semen in regards to DNA forensics. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Most of it will therefore remain on the child in a dried form until it takes a bath or a shower, thus it can be swabbed for a DNA test in the meanwhile.

                         Humans loose a lot of hair everyday. We loose hair from our heads, bodies and genitals.

                         Leaving hair from your head or body onto a child's clothes or any legal area of its body, isn't all that dangerous. But, leaving your <u>genitalia</u> hair on a child's body or clothes will much easier prove sexual molestation, at least as circumstantial evidence. And most pedophiles don't think about the fact that genitalia hair is actually very stiff and unique, while easily braking off and entangles with textiles.

                         Many pedophiles have been sentenced to long prison times because the law enforcement found genital hair from the pedophiles either on the children's bodies or in their panties. Sometimes it has been just 1 single genital hair from a pedophile that has sentenced him 10-20 years in prison, which also has happened a few times with female pedophiles.

                         And the latter can also happen in regards to saliva traces at unfortunate parts of children bodies, and even clothings.

                         The only way to deal with the saliva threat, is simply to <u>avoid</u> kissing and licking children. And I know, it hurts reading that. But that is actually the <u>only</u> way to deal with it. However, you may <u>smell</u> the children's skin and intimate parts if you want to.

                         The easiest way to deal with the hair threat is to take a thorough shower right before any illegal child love practice, while <u>really</u> scrubbing and massaging the hair on your head and genitals. This will wash away most of the loose and partially broken hair strains, thus make it far less likely to leave any behind.
                         
                         <br />

                         Many pedophiles actually shave their genitals completely before interacting sexually with children, which is much easier done than it might seem like, and can make the difference between freedom and prison time if you should ever be accused for it and a child becomes forensically investigated. However, a child may then tell the law enforcement, during interrogations, that your penis had no hair on it; which actually can become a witness proof, though not with the same evidence weight in court as genital hair though.

                         Pedophiles rarely bleed during sexual activities with children. However, lots of children do.

                         Blood from sexual activities with children almost always comes from penetrating their genitals or rectums; which may sound barbaric, but is actually quite normal for both children and adults during first-time penetrations and intercourses. Rectal bleeding can sometimes happen with even trained children, as the rectum tissue is quite fragile.

                         Actually, children bleed a lot during their whole childhood, because they often get injuries and wounds from harsh play, making 'bleeding children' a pretty common phenomena.

                         So, if the police should find e.g. blood drops from your neighbor kid on your living room chair or carpet, it won't actually prove sexual abuse. But, if they find its blood in your bedroom, especially in your bed sheets, it <u>can</u> be proved.

                         You may also have the child's blood onto your own body or clothes, which also is quite dangerous; at least until you jump into a bathtub and put all the infected clothes into a washing machine on a harsh and hot washing program.

                         Dealing with genitalia and rectum blood from children is actually very easy: always lay a towel underneath the child's hips before any penetration training or regular sexual intercourse. And right afterwards, wash that towel in a machine on the highest possible temperature.

                         Just keep in mind that the law enforcement may get a search warrant for your home and car if a child accuses you for sexual abuse or rape. And if the child has left any blood within either, it may become much harder for you to get away.

                         However, cleaning up DNA today is enormously difficult:

                         Special liquids can be applied to any area, which will light up under controlled conditions if there's semen or blood present. Special UV lighting at particular wavelengths can also be used to detect either.

                         These visual techniques are used by crime scene investigators to gather proofs; and they prove that when you <u>think</u> you're cleaning up blood or semen, you are <u>instead</u> just smearing it out all over the place, which can be conveniently swabbed up later by crime scene investigators.

                         And, they don't need any large samples either; the latest generation DNA testing works well with really small samples, even so small that you can't see them with the naked eye. And, forensic specialists just <u>know</u> where to swab for such tiny samples that you never thought could ever exist.

                         And do all this after <u>every</u> sexual activity when close body intimacy and body fluids has been involved.

                         If this sounds bothersome and unnecessary, please note that there are many pedophiles out there who have been sent to prison for decades just because they where to lazy to do these three simple tasks. Had they done them persistently, the law enforcement would not have had a single evidence, thus their outcomes would've been different: as in freedom.

                         However, a fully sexual intercourse with a kiddie vagina is a bit tougher to clean up right after the act. The vagina <u>will</u> clean itself eventually, of course, but not immediately.

                                   You should never attempt to manually clean a vagina internally, as that can disturb the natural flora inside it, which can cause infections; which again can cause hell to break loose if a doctor detects that the kid has been fucked.

                         Those with less to no control over the child and crime scene will obviously have to be way more careful about evidence, because any cleaning becomes way more difficult.

                         Of course, if you're hunting for children outdoors, and have sex with little strangers whom you'll never see again, this won't be all that critical. But if you <u>do</u> spill your sperm on a little stranger, and that little stranger runs home and tells about it, your DNA will be put into a police database, which may come back and bite you later.

                         Destroying DNA is extremely difficult, as it is a very though and resistant matter to break down and make untestable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may think that soap or alcohol does the trick, but it rather just smears the DNA out all over the surface you're cleaning, and making it even easier for the forensics to detect it later.
                         
                         <br />

                         However, it is not indestructible. You <u>can</u> destroy DNA with bleach; not always completely, but usually enough to make a test inconclusive, thus not valid in court. It <u>is</u> however important that the bleach contains <b class="h">sodium hypochlorite</b>.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, crime labs use sodium hypochlorite based bleach to clean their work stations between samples, to prevent contamination, usually with a 1:10 ratio of bleach and water.
                         
                         <br />

                         I do have to emphasize though, that sodium hypochlorite shouldn't be used to wipe human skin. It can cause rashes and even burns. It can also, well, bleach stuff.

                         Our modern way of communicating through digital devices hasn't only revolutionized human communication in general, but also revolutionized the whole pedophilia community.

                         It has become easier than ever before to find children and keep in touch with them through these technological marvels. Many pedophiles, especially the young newcomers, are very attracted to and depended upon these devices.

                         However, when things become a little bit <u>too</u> easy and convenient, it is usually wise to become cautious:

                         The evil parts of digital communication are digital traces and honeypot entrapments. Almost everything you do through digital communication devices today, is logged <u>somewhere</u> and linked to your name and address. And you can never be completely sure if that sweet 10 year old boy in a chat room, who wants to hook up with you and play some sex games, really is a sweet, curious and horny 10 year old boy, and not a disguised fat old law enforcement officer who's setting up entrapments for pedophiles all day long behind his desk while eating donuts and drinking coffee.

                         <br />
                         
                         Honeypot entrapments can actually become extremely dangerous, because there are civilian anti-pedophile groups out there who also lure pedophiles in similar ways. But <u>these</u> entrapments are instead based on illegal scare, fear and torture, aka the movie Hard Candy, which can involve a lot of nasty stuff. It can even involve a slow and painful death.

                         I shit you not when I say that I <u>know</u> about several real life cases of such, making this movie almost an obligatory watch for all active pedophiles, as a warning against digital communication and general carelessness in that regard.

                         Digital communication is for new school pedophiles, and is extremely easy and convenient; you can find several children within an hour, and begin communicating with them instantly. But, it can also be a very risky and dangerous business to involve yourself into, which is why I personally swear to the old school method of finding children: <span class="glow_red">Hunting Season</span>, along with the rest of the methods covered in the next guide that will teach you how to find and befriend children.

                         But even those pedophiles who find children through any old school method, may still be tempted to keep in touch with some of them, and conveniently do that through computers (Facebook, mails, etc) and cellphones.

                         The problem with such communication is the continuous buildup of a large pile of <u>external</u> evidence against you, meaning evidence stored not only on your computer and cellphone, but also at your Internet and cellphone service providers, which the law enforcement agencies can dive into and have a field day with if you ever get caught.

                         Computers are owned by almost everyone today, which also includes children. Most of these computers are linked together by the Internet, thus why so many pedophiles use their computers to find and befriend children, and generally keep in touch with them over time.

                         So, let's take a look at the solutions to these problems:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <ul>
                              
                                   <li class="space">Use a free and open source operating system, like Linux, ideally with only free and open source software installed; especially a Linux distribution that is initially clean and takes user privacy seriously, like Debian or Fedora Linux.</li>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Use a fully encrypted operating system for illegal usage, ideally on a hard disk drive that you disconnect and swap with a normal and legal disk when done, to safely hide the illegal disk somewhere safe when not in use.</li>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">You can safely use SSD disks if they are fully encrypted <u>before</u> using them for illegal activities and data.</li>
                                                                      
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Use the Tor network correctly when communicating anonymously with children through kiddie websites on the Internet. If you need to use Java safely, e.g. to access chat rooms and other Java-required apps, you will also need to use a firewalled Linux OS; like Tails Linux.</li>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Never use your real name nor a real email address, always use nicknames and anonymous email addresses created and maintained <u>only</u> through the Tor network.</li>
                                                                 
                              </ul>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The whole idea here is to create a 100% separation between your normal and pedophilic activities on your computer, and hide all pedophilic activities by swapping and hiding illegal drives, so the law enforcement will be left with nothing other than a legal disk that only shows legal and normal activities.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         For example: your legal and regular disk can contain a regular Windows OS that you use for regular activities, like banking, webshops, news and gaming. This should be the same disk that your e.g. wife uses regularly and your friends use when visiting. When you're alone and want to do illegal activities, like grooming kids and teens online, take out the regular disk and insert the illegal one. And as soon as you're done doing illegal things, swap the regular disk back, hide the illegal one under a floorboard or something, and everything will both seem and be normal and secure on any regular day.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you ever chat with children through a web camera, while of course using the Tor network correctly, make sure that you change your appearance some while being online. Also use a dim room so you become less visible in details, as web cameras become extremely noisy and blurry in bad lighting.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Pedophile entrapments on the Internet, which are arranged by the law enforcement, are usually done with web cameras and young adult females within the law enforcement who basically look very young, but are additionally dressed up in a youthful style with a childish hairdo and clothing. Some also use voice manipulators to make the female sound much younger than she really is through the Internet and phone. They even create fake Facebook sites and identities, making it very hard to distinguish between false and real deals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, for the law enforcement to be able to gather enough evidence to arrest you during a real life meeting and entrapment, they are <u>required</u> to make you communicate about sex and <u>admit</u> that you're meeting the fake child in question for sexual activities.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, a neat trick to try separating traps from real deals is to not talk about sex, and instead focus your communication on friendship and care; saying that you will only meet as friends (to begin with), and never actually admit that you aim for a sexual relationship. Most law enforcement agents will then loose their interest in you, as they cannot acquire the required evidence needed for an arrest when you show up, and will thus leave you to try another pedophile instead; while the real kids will more likely still stay with you and be the ones who still wants to meet you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, some of these agents are very patient; so they might try to build a friendship with you, as a fake underage, to <u>eventually</u> make you talk about sex and admit that you want to hook up for <u>that</u> exactly. Therefore, and even though you think you know an Internet kid well, never talk about sex in an incriminating way <u>before</u> you meet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After you've met and seen the child in person, it will be much safer from there and on to chat about sex and arrange meetings of such.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If an Internet kid seems very sexually focused, and almost desperately tries to make you communicate about sex and make plans to meet for sex, it is most likely an entrapment.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But whatever you think you're dealing with on the Internet, you can never be completely sure; which is the main headache with this kind of communication.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When meeting the kid, make sure to do so at a <u>public</u> area with lots of people around. Never accept meeting the kid at its own home or any other private address, as that is the way most entrapments work. Tell the kid that you'll be wearing something unique, so she or he will recognize you; but instead wear something completely different, while looking for the kid from a safe distance.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Be very careful when making contact, and stay around other people as long as possible while getting to know each other. Visit e.g. ice cream booths and toy stores, and try to make sure that you aren't followed.

                         Most children nowadays have cellphones, even as young as first-graders. Thus, these devices can become pretty effective tools for pedophiles to keep in touch with children, arrange secret meetings, and more.

                         However, and just as with computers, these technological marvels for pedophiles do also have some serious drawbacks. Actually, they're utterly insecure to use, unless you're very technologically skilled.

                         When communicating with children through cellphones, by voice and text, there are a few things to be aware of:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <ul>
                                        
                                   <li class="space">Every outgoing and incoming call is logged at your phone company. These logs include dates, times and lengths of all conversations. These logs can potentially exist forever, and eventually prove whom you've been talking to, when you talked together, and for how long.</li>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Every text message you send and receive, is also logged just like your calls are; and the content of each message may additionally be logged too. This includes multimedia text messages with media attachments.</li>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">When you delete something on your cellphone, whatever it is, it can easily be retrieved by computer forensics later. Such data is stored almost in the same way as data is stored on SSD disks; so even when using secure delete apps, almost everything can still be restored later.</li>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Smartphones can be encrypted, but that is useless when all of them have zero privacy anyway. iPhone, Windows and Android phones are in reality spy devices that follow your every action and move in various ways through various apps. These tracking data are stored on the phone itself, and sometimes synced with external servers owned by various third-parties who don't have your privacy nor your security in their interest. Apple, Microsoft and Google, who more or less control the smartphone market today, represent Satan himself in regards to user privacy.</li>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">A cellphone can also reveal your whereabouts to a certain extent, even though its GPS module has been disabled, because your phone company also stores which cell towers your cellphone is and has been connected to. Some apps can even switch your GPS module on for just a few seconds, and then switch it off again, without you ever noticing it.</li>
                                                                                                                   
                              </ul>

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Nowadays, cellphones have become so usual that most of us use them without thinking twice about it. But neither do people think about potential espionage and lack of privacy, which too many times send pedophiles to prison.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These devices should therefore and ideally <u>never</u> be used for <u>any</u> pedo related nor any illegal activities, and <u>always</u> considered as <u>enemies</u> of the pedophiles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, this causes a huge dilemma for many pedophiles, especially those who're into longterm relationships with mature children, as smartphones have become so popular and pretty much a complete necessity among these children. So, if you're ever going to succeed making and keeping contact with these children, you're almost forced to enter their digital smartphone worlds.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The only safe option for pedophiles who need a cellphone to communicate with children, is to use secret dumbphones with anonymous SIM-cards.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         One way to accomplish this, is to travel to an area that sells prepaid cellphones that can be bought at downtown shops and kiosks anonymously with cash.

                         Another way is to buy second hand cellphones anonymously, from people far away from you home, by paying cash and giving them a fake name. Then buy several prepaid SIM-cards anonymously that you use with this 'new' phone of yours.

                         Always pay with cash for this, never use credit cards!

                         And never have this secret phone turned on, nor have it on you, on an everyday basis. Always keep it switched off and hidden, and only turn it on and use it when communicating with the children.

                         These options won't be bulletproof, but neither will they make a direct link between your phone number and your true ID. This will be important if you should ever get caught.

                         So far we've been talking about how to stay safe and anonymous when using computers and cellphones to find and communicate with children.

                         But, how about when you can't be anonymous?
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may communicate with children as non-anonymous too, but this should <u>only</u> be reserved for local children, like your own family or neighbor kids, or when being a teacher who communicates with his favorite pupils.

                         Here are some important rules to follow in this regard:

                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <ul>
                    
                                   <li class="space">Never send erotically or sexually oriented messages to your children through phones, emails and chatting.</li>
                                   
                                   <div>This can become indirect confessions that may be stored at your various service providers, and used against you in court as crucial evidence if you ever get caught.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Only communicate digitally as if you where friends only.</li>
                                   
                                   <div>This will prove that you have only been good friends, even though if the child should claim otherwise later in life.</div>
                                                                      
                                   <li class="space">Agree to use custom secret codes during communication related to illegal stuff. These codes should be non-apparent codes: e.g. asking to come along and shop can mean meeting up for sex.</li>
                                   
                                   <div>Such codes will be extremely hard to prove as illegal activities, even though if the child should claim so.</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">Make the children agree to be a part of these three rules, and arrange them together <b class="h">face to face</b>.</li>
                                   
                                   <div>If they agree to follow these rules, they will much better understand this final security policy of yours:</div>
                                   
                                   <li class="space">If the child should forget these rules, or be forced to gather evidence by their parents or the law enforcement, thus send you sexually oriented messages, reply as if you don't understand what the child is talking about.</li>
                                   
                              </ul>

                         You would've been amazed to know how many pedophiles who've been sent to prison with the only physical evidence against them being a communication screwup on their computers or cellphones, when having communicated with their underage lovers.

                         I've studied several news cases about pedophiles worldwide, and these screwups are being constantly repeated, and are usually based on text messages and chatting that have been sent by the pedophiles, which contain indirect confessions:

                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "God damn, it was sooo freakin' hot screwing your tight little pussy last night in the backseat of my SUV!! I can't wait to enter that wet tightness again tomorrow, as soon as you get home from school!! Many kisses from your lover, Don!!"
                         
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         If they had <u>not</u> sent such incriminating messages to their children, they would've been set free from all the charges, as such messages are usually the only proofs the law enforcement and prosecutors have and relay heavily upon.

                         By writing such messages, some pedophiles have actually ended up with lifetime sentences in prison. But could've gotten away with it and been free as birds today <u>if</u> they had only followed the very simply and latter security policy.
