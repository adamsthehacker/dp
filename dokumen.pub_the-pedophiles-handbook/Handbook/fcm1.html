                         My third recommendation for finding children is to turn your own home into a kiddie magnet, which will attract children like magnets attract metal.

                         The basis for this recommendation is that this method has some very special and effective advantages for people who either got special needs or just want some very easy and convenient ways to find children; <u>if</u> you got the nerves to live with its somehow significant disadvantages.

                         You actually don't need to go anywhere with this method, as it will be all centered at your own home.

                         This method is thus extremely advantageous for those who either are low on resources or have any illnesses of either mental or physical characters, all of which make you less mobile and less likely to succeed with the other methods.

                         This is also a great method for the less mobile elders.

                         Or, you can be an otherwise wealthy and strong person who just wants to easily and conveniently use your own home to find children lovers and sex toys.

                         Except for the preparations needed to turn your property into a huge kiddie magnet, this method doesn't require you to take any active parts in finding children at all, as the children will now find <u>you</u> and come to <u>you</u> instead.

                         <br />
                         
                         After the preparations are done, just sit down in your favorite chair, maybe in your garden at summertime with a cold drink, and just wait for the children to show up.

                         If that's not easy and convenient, then I don't know what is.

                         An obstacle that many pedophiles meet, who actively search for children outside their homes, is the lacking control of their environments. They often find themselves in unknown territories, which may contain unknown pitfalls and traps.

                         <br />
                         
                         With this method, this won't be a problem. Now you will be seducing children at a place that you know best and where you're most comfortable at, and the place you control and rule everyday, which is your own home and property.

                         <u>You</u> will be in total control of your environment, while the children and their parents will <u>not</u>, giving you a very important upper hand in regards to preparations and seductions.

                         This is a statement that we don't see all that often, do we?

                         Actually, the poorer and more crowded your local community is, the more successful this method will become.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you're already poor, you are probably already living there, thus good to go. If you're wealthy, you should easily be able to get yourself a second home in such a community.

                         So, <u>everyone</u> can make this happen!

                         The fact is that poor children have rarely any nice or exciting stuff to play with. If you then add alcohol and drug abuse, mistreatment and neglect, mental problems and passiveness, all of which are common ingredients among parents of such communities, this method can actually do wonders for you as a pedophile.

                         Because, if <u>your</u> lot can offer these children exciting things to look at and play with, things that they can become attached to, <u>they</u> will come. And they will come back, again and again.

                         It might even become difficult getting rid of them(!).

                         This method is primarily based on using your lot as a magnet. And such magnets work best when being located in regular family neighborhoods where there's a decent amount of children moving and playing around.
                         
                         <br />

                         Without any children around, what is there to attract?

                         This works thus less for those who live in quite remote country sides and sparsely populated communities, with large distanced between the homes.

                         This method is mostly effective for those who have an outside garden, which ideally has a decent size with both publicly viewable and private parts.

                         If you share a garden with a landlord or with other neighbors, or you live in a house or an apartment without any gardens at all, this method will become less successful.

                         While living alone isn't a totally unfamiliar concept for many pedophiles, most people do still live with a partner or a family, or sharing their homes with roomies.
                         
                         <br />

                         Living with a family or in a shared home won't be a total show stopper, but it will nevertheless be a party brake. All the people you're sharing your home with will become obstacles to your pedophile freedom in regards to this method.

                         This method works best for those who either live completely alone or have the whole property for themselves at the evenings, as this will give you the control and privacy needed to successfully bond with children, and finally seduce them.

                         When being an active pedophile in your <u>own</u> local community, seducing and having sex with children will create some challenges and dangers that are unique for such areas.

                         It'll become much harder to get away if anything goes wrong, and the margins for errors will be very small.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you should ever gain any pedophilic suspicions, those suspicions will stay with you next to forever and make it hard for you to live a normal life in that neighborhood. If you should get caught for any illegal activities, things will get even worse. This will also affect family and friends who live there too.

                         If you really treasure your own home and neighborhood, you may want to consider creating a second home in another neighborhood for this method, <u>if</u> you got the economy for it.
