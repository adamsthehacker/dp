                         Welcome to the final and smallest chapter of this guide, but still one of the most important ones.
                         
                         <br />

                         Since you've just gone through the very important education about children personality traits, to better understand how individual personalities affect children behavior, it is now time to follow that thread, and thus move to yet another underestimated subject within pedophilia and child love practice, which is <u>chemistry</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Chemistry is a word that probably sounds like belonging to a science lab. But within human psychology, this word represents one of the most important factors within human social relationships.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Chemistry explains how well two human beings go together. You may switch this word with 'compatibility', and it should become even clearer what this is all about.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Two people who have good chemistry, in other words have good compatibility, will feel very comfortable and at ease when being together, at all possible levels:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may have noticed this a few times in your life, when you have met a total stranger, but felt a weird sense that you have known this person all your life. This also regards all the people whom you <u>prefer</u> and <u>enjoy</u> hanging out with, which causes you to trust and respect them, as well as liking them. You can easily talk together, and you have lots of things to talk about. And even when you're both quiet, it still feels comfortable being together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Two people who have bad chemistry, in other words have bad compatibility, will feel very uncomfortable when being together and interacting with each other, like if there's a negative tension in the whole room that you're both in:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may have noticed that as well, meeting a person that you simply don't like, even though you have just met and have no apparent reasons for disliking the person. Such chemistry can sometimes become so bad that the person feels gross and nasty, even if he or she hasn't done you anything negative. You have additionally nothing to talk about, except for the weather maybe, and then just silence; and the silence feels awful, so you try making up conversations to avoid it. You simply feel bad around that person, and you just want to avoid him or her as much as possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is chemistry at its best and its worst; and it can happen in different degrees, towards either end, with any person.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                    
                         
                         Chemistry can also become quite strange:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>You</u> may have two best friends whom you like equally much, friend A and friend B. So logically, they should also like each other, right? Because that just makes sense. In reality however, they might not. Friend A and B may actually have pretty bad chemistry and dislike each other, even though they both have good chemistry with <u>you</u>. So, it kind of doesn't make sense after all. But, that is how our biology just works, which proves how complex chemistry really is.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There are few good scientific explanations for this strange social phenomena among humans, expect for one, which is my personal favorite:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Look at chemistry as radio waves, and that all of us have a radio inside ourselves tuned to a certain frequency range, which we cannot change. When you meet people, you will meet a lot of different frequencies. When you meet a person with a radio that's way off <u>your</u> frequency range, your radios aren't able to communicate, like real radios, thus you don't understand each other on a subconscious level. You will simply have difficulties communicating in general. But then you meet a person who are at the same frequency as <u>you</u> are, with no static noises at all, clear as a bell, thus you can now fully understand each other subconsciously and communicate well. Thus, you will like each other very much.

                         <b>Chemistry and Pedophilia</b>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When it comes to relationships between pedophiles and children, especially romantic and sexual relationships, chemistry suddenly becomes more important than it has ever been and will ever be in your life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Now, let us go back to this person again whom you once met, whom you felt really uncomfortable with and wanted to avoid as much as possible, the one whom made you gross. Imagine yourself being pushed or forced to have an intimate relationship with such a person. Or even worse, a sexual relationship. And have that on a regular basis. It doesn't feel especially nice, does it? No it doesn't. This would most likely have become a traumatic experience for you, especially over time, which could actually have made you mentally ill.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And this is <u>exactly</u> why some children end up mentally ill after having had a sexual relationship with such an adult, especially over a longer period of time. It wasn't the sexual relationship <u>itself</u> that caused this, but instead the bad chemistry and discomfort the child felt while being pushed or forced to have an intimate and sexual relationship with that adult. And this can happen even though the adult is kind towards the child. Their bad chemistry simply fucks up the child's mental health, as <u>everyone</u> would've experienced in similar circumstances, regardless of age and gender.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These are the children, in addition to rape victims, who most commonly end up mentally traumatized from sexual relationships with adults, while <u>feeling</u> abused and molested, even though if the relationship wasn't forceful. They become troubled children as they grow towards adolescence, with various problems at various levels, who eventually tells about what happened. This usually leads to a police report, which finally leads to an arrest of the pedophile in question.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Both lost, and both got destroyed; simply because we humans are <u>such</u> sensitive to bad chemistry.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If we now switch this around to a relationship between an adult and a child who share a <u>really</u> good chemistry, as in enjoying each others company, trusting each other fully, treating each other nicely, and loving each other fully, the child will almost <u>always</u> grow up and remember that sexual relationship as something very exciting, delicious, positive and educative.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Suddenly you see that these scenarios switch from Hell to Heaven, simply because a <b class="h">good chemistry</b> becomes the basis for a sexual relationship between an adult and a child.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A lot of parents and children have experienced this, and still love each other as adults with many special and positive memories. Some are even still lovers, as adults. And all this does also apply to any other family relationship, and all non-relative relationships of course. Because, they had either a good or an ideal chemistry.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, ideal chemistry relationships may still be reported by the child later in life, if it has been really brainwashed by the society, while the pedophile did a bad job at preventing that brainwashing from affecting their relationship negatively..

                         Most sexual relationships between adults and children, who've shared an excellent chemistry between each other, don't end up as reported. Most of these children end up as adults with only positive memories, and a forever friendship with the person who made love to them as children.

                         But, since these children have no reasons to tell about this, you rarely hear from those positive endings. You mostly hear about the bad ones, which reach the news headlines; which in the end is yet another reason why pedophilia and child love practice is so misunderstood and hated in our society.

                         As a therapist, I've been working with so many adults who've had positive sexual relationships with adults as children, who wouldn't have gone back and changed it even if they could. Because of my occupation, I can see those positive endings that most of you never hear about, and I want all of you to know that they exist in huge numbers.

                         It should now become clear how utterly important it is to choose good chemistry when you're about to choose a child to seduce and make love to. The chemistry doesn't have to be pitch perfect, but it should be basically good, so you make sure that you really enjoy each other while protecting both yourself and the child from potential problems in the future.

                         Choosing a good chemistry is equal to choosing a good insurance policy!

                         This means that when you're about to find yourself a new friend and a little lover, you just can't pick <u>anyone</u>, just because they are children and available. Many pedophiles do that, but then end up in trouble, sooner or later. And trouble in this regard, usually means hard time in prison.

                         So, when choosing a child for child love practice, you really need to find that child whom you feel fully comfortable being around. And the child needs to feel the same towards you. You really need to have that special and unique chemistry, that special connection and bond, as this will increase the final success of your relationship, and seal your faith.

                         Please note that early relationships may need some <u>time</u> for trust to develop; so always give new relationships time, and see if that can make you check more elements on this list.

                         Also note that good chemistry is mostly important for short and longterm relationships with children being <u>close</u> to you. When you're hunting outdoors and far away from your home, as an anonymous pedophile, and only practice onetime sexual activities with children, good chemistry won't be that important; and negative chemistry won't have that much damage effect on the child's mental health either.

                         And remember that great chemistry won't only make your relationships more positive and safe in the long run, it will also make it much easier to get <u>into</u> their panties in the first place.
