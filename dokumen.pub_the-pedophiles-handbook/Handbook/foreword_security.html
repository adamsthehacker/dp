                         We are now going down and into the <span style="text-shadow: 0px 0px 4px #666666">dark</span> basement of the handbook, with only a flickering candle, moving past spiders, rats and shadows that look like monsters, with sudden and startling noises that make us gasp and turn quickly around.

                         Few people really want to go down and into this scary place, it's much more convenient to skip it and just stay in the light and warmth of <u>only</u> learning about the exciting things about child love practice. But by forcing yourself to enter this abyss, and going all the way through it, you will eventually come back into the light again as an educated person within the most important subject of pedophilia practice. By skipping it, you will end up with a loss that may one day become your downfall, as unfortunately regards too many pedos out there.

                         We are talking about the inevitable, and that is the <u>danger</u> of practicing illegal child love, which is a frighting subject for both newbies and experienced to go through.

                         If we look scientifically at the subject of security, the danger of practicing illegal child love is actually all about <u>information</u>.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All illegal activities you perform with children, and whatever physical residues you leave behind during them, is actually information. And if any of this information leaks to any third-party, an unfortunate situation will most likely happen; which usually involves the law enforcement, thus legal actions may sooner or later be taken against you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Pedophilia security is therefore all about <u>preventing</u> information leakages from your illegal activities with children, which this security guide has been especially built to do.

                         <br />
                         
                         By following <u>all</u> security recommendations in this guide, and making sure you always follow them when practicing illegal child love, not only will the likelihood of getting caught decrease significantly, but it will also help you to more easily get away if you <u>do</u> get caught.

                         This security guide and preparation system has been used by many professional pedophiles for many years, but unfortunately not been used by those with less experience, or those who didn't have access to this information.
