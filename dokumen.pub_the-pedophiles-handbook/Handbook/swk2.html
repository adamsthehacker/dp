                         As soon as the children grow into preschoolers and young elementary schoolers, they are becoming some seriously sexy little beings; with their long and slick bodies, puffy faces, nasty behavior, general wildness, and with almost too much sluttiness and horniness for an average pedophile to handle.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         As they grow towards adolescence, they will become increasingly adult like in almost all aspects, while still keeping their physical slickness and general childish properties; making this whole group of children a huge bag of candy with so many different flavors to choose from as pedophiles.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, these children will <u>also</u> become increasingly challenging to seduce and have sex with as they grow through this stage and become older, making the younger part of this group more ideal for the newbies and skeptics, while the older part is more ideal for those who either are more experienced or simply want more challenges as pedophiles.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         But they <u>do</u> get much safer to have sex with as they grow through this stage as well, as in becoming increasingly better at keeping secrets, while increasingly calming down to more stable and predictable beings for all sorts of sex practice.

                         This group of children doesn't take things that serious, in the same time as being very curious. They can thus do some pretty crazy stuff with adults, even with strangers whom they don't know at all, and especially in groups.

                         And this age group can be safely fucked in all holes, as long as they're properly trained in advance.

                         Whatever age you'll be aiming for within this group of children, I can promise you that this group is the most exciting one for pedophiles to seduce and have sex with. If you want to experience excitement, heavy arousal and crazy ejaculations, this group won't disappoint you; whatever you are or aren't.

                         Those who are about to practice sex with this age group will most likely be among one or several of the following groups:

                         As you can see, this group of children is highly accessible for pedophiles initially, but will obviously become increasingly more accessible with age, maturity and psychical freedom.

                                   These children need <u>more</u> increments and thoroughness during the initiation process and sexual activities, contrary to any other group, and are more fragile to common mistakes done by inexperienced pedophiles; all of which increases the risk of mental trauma. It is therefore recommended that this chapter is thoroughly understood and followed when you practice sex with children within this age group.

                         As soon as the children grow out from the toddler stage and into young children, at about 4 years of age, real sexual seductions of other children and adults is starting to appear.
                         
                         <br />

                         Their egocentric sexual interest and motivation from their baby and toddler stage will gradually shift towards a social sexual interest and motivation, which means seeking and enjoying sexual companionship with <u>other</u> humans.
                         
                         <br />

                         They will be just as much engaged in sexual play with children as with adults, as they're not yet able to separate the two. However, since adult genitalia is obviously less accessible and quite forbidden in the average modern society, sexual play with adults is therefore way more <u>interesting</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such great sexual interest can quickly make some of these children act sexually towards adults in various ways, but mostly as an attempt to look at and explore their genitalia.

                         It usually happens in a very primitive and straight forward way, easily interpretable and hard to misunderstand as an adult, contrary to the adolescents who are way more emotionally and sexually complex and shy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This sexual behavior towards adults will be most aggressive at the first half of this age group, and from there decrease some and become more complex and cautious as they grow towards adolescence.

                         In other words, the children of <u>this</u> group are the children who're most likely to seduce an adult actively.

                         This phenomena makes these girls bond in special ways with adult males, which starts out with what you may call flirting.

                         You can easily notice how they flirt with adult males when these males participate in their everyday play and madness. Just observe these girls when an adult male e.g. enters a preschool facility or elementary school to help out: he will risk getting surrounded by little girls who will climb all over him, fight for his lap, tease, pull and push him around, depending on the age and maturity of the girls.

                         This is a very common phenomena, and why most adult males are especially popular among the girls of this group.

                         <br />
                         
                         The underground theory behind this phenomena within psychology is that this is an evolutionary advantage; as it gives these girls the opportunity to <u>practice</u> on flirting and seductions from a very early point of their lives, <u>and</u> practice such on adult males whom obviously got real romantic and sexual experience to <u>share</u>.

                         <br />
                         
                         Reproduction is the most important function of any living species, and these little girls start to practice on that pretty early to gain as much experience as possible, so they can become good genetic reproducers at puberty when nature wants them to reproduce.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Their ability to actually fall in love with <u>adult</u> males, further supports this theory about how the human nature obviously works to create reproductive advantages.

                         Or course, they aren't able to <u>intellectually</u> define flirting, neither do they intellectually understand the purpose of it; this is simply just a part of their natural instincts and behavior, as they're seeking important wisdom and practice. Their brains are simply hardwired to flirt with experienced males.

                         But, there's a fine line between flirting and sex for these kids. So, they can easily connect these two dots, which will make them able to instinctively take that final step, and sexually seduce an adult male in their usual childish, playful, curious and flimsy way; which is extremely hot to experience as a genuine pedophile, or a teleiophile with a low self-esteem and general insecurities towards adult females.

So their way of seducing other children and adults will be mostly based on pure genital and sexual <u>curiosity</u> instead.

                         But you <u>may</u> say that the boys actually <u>balance</u> this lack by being much more wild and rough beings, and less afraid in general, than female children. This makes them more likely to seduce adults through a more wild and rough curiosity.

                         <br />
                         
                         And of course, I should also add that the boys are also usually less protected and easier to access in general.

                         <span class="glow_orange">Both genders</span> have many different ways of seducing adults. But the two most common ways of doing it, is through either physical or verbal suggestion:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Physical suggestions happen usually through physical play, while being alone together, like cuddling, tickling or fighting. They start to touch or hit your private parts, to see how you react to it. And they will continue doing that more intensively as you go along with it, which potentially may end with an verbal suggestion.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Physical suggestions can also happen through silly play when they become a little bit naughty and crazy in the same time, and start to show off their bums and genitals by pulling their pants quickly down and up, to show off. This happens mostly when there are two or more of them at the location, while they all feel safe and comfortable with your presence.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />                    
                         
                         A more rare physical suggestion, usually reserved for those really close and trusting relationships, is when they simply just start to open your pants and go straight for your genitals, without even asking about it; especially if they've already sensed that you are acceptant towards such.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Verbal suggestions are just what they sound like; they will simply suggest showing your genitals to each other, or ask specifically to see yours only. They may optionally start this activity by talking or kidding about genitals in general, to first test your tolerance for this subject and such play.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Another type of seduction, which actually happens a lot, but can be hard to exploit, is when they spy at you while you're either peeing or undressing. This can also happen when there are two or more of them around; giggling and being ecstatic. This is hard to exploit because they don't want you to know that they're watching in the first place, but still being very curious about your genitals; which is very hot to experience as a pedophile, while not being totally impossible to exploit, because you will then know that they really <u>are</u> curious about adult genitalia, making them easier to <b class="h">trigger</b>.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It can also happen through a real sensitive seduction, usually when an adult male is all alone with a female child while physically cuddling together, like on a couch or bed. The child can start to rub itself towards the adult while becoming sexually aroused. Or, it can start to touch the adult at various places of his body to see how he reacts, sometimes as a part of being sexually aroused. This suggestion and seduction happens mostly between fathers and daughters, or any close relative to the child, when they both have a <u>very</u> unique and <u>very</u> close and intimate relationship in general. It can also happen when the female child is totally in love with the adult.

                         <br />
                         
                         A general rule is that sexual seductions from children usually happen when you're both alone and intimate together, they will thus less likely seduce you in active and stormy environments with lots going on and happening all around you.

                         <br />
                         
                         Regardless of how it happens, most genuine pedophiles will quickly and easily notice it, and realize what's really going on.

                         And this is when the pink sugar cotton hits the fan for real, and you will suddenly have important decisions to make.

                         The latter children can be very easily triggered though!

                         Any of the samples mentioned earlier in the Passive Initiation section, can be triggered in various ways, which usually ends with success if the pedophile is being sharp and patient.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The first thing you can try doing, is to create a decent basis for physical play; like jumping into a bed, while the child is around, and just lay down in it, hoping that the child will jump into the bed as well to play and have fun.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If it does get into the bed, but doesn't initiate any physical play all by itself, you may try initiating it yourself, like pushing the child over just for fun, or start tickling or fighting with it. Then things can happen, especially if you additionally touch it in a loving and erotic way at non-genital areas.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also suggest non-sexual games that can easily turn into sexual games, like playing house, and suggesting that you are the father, the child is the mother, and a baby doll is your child. The child may want to kiss the adult, sleep in the same bed, and so forth, as being realistic parts of the game.

                                   Actually, there's a sexual activity later in this chapter that is <u>based</u> on playing house with children, which you later may want to check out and exploit.
                                        
                              </div>

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It can also be a dress-up, fashion and makeup game; giving the child certain clothes of a sexual character to try out in front of you. And then complimenting its braveness and body while it changes clothes and shows off. Such games can quickly become sexualized, triggering the child to show off <u>more</u> of its body, while enjoying it and getting compliments; even triggering some sexual curiosity and arousal inside it.
                         
                         <br />

                         Cuddling is a potential winner, and this works especially well on children who highly enjoy cuddle. This is all about laying in a bed or couch together, and just cuddling. You will of course have to touch the child in a loving and erotic way all over, except for its genitals and butt; maybe kiss the child carefully on its cheeks, and even kiss it on its lips, if you feel comfortable kissing the child in question. You may then create some serious arousal within the child; girls especially. You should at least create a decent basis for sexual curiosity and exploration, regardless of the child's gender.

                         If you want to take things even further, and being more bold, you may initiate conversations about genitals, which most children should be excited to talk about anyway.
                         
                         <br />

                         A very easy way to do this, is to tell a weird story:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Do you know what I saw yesterday? I passed by another adult who was peeing outdoors! And I could see her/his pee-pee!"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now you've initiated a genital conversation, which in some cases can be enough for the child to start talking more about genitals, which can eventually lead to your own genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         An alternate and more direct question, or a continuation of the previous, could be something as easy as this:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Have you ever seen an adult's pee-pee before?"

                         <br />
                         
                         You don't need to <u>suggest</u> showing yours to the child, since we're only trying to trigger a passive seduction, but rather <u>hope</u> that the child eventually asks for it. We're only placing seeds of curiosity within the child at this stage, which <u>may</u> start growing, either at once or within a few days.

                         You may also initiate a conversation about flowers and bees, as in asking the child if it knows how a baby is created.

                                   "All males have a penis. And inside the penis, there are special seeds. If a male puts his penis into a girl's vagina, and puts those seeds into her, one of those seeds will grow into a little baby inside that girl's tummy; just like a flower seed grows into a beautiful flower. This is how we create babies, by using the penis, which is very special and exciting."
                         
                              </div>

                         The child should now become <u>very</u> excited about this highly exotic information, <u>which</u> you may (probably should) ask the child to keep as a secret between the two of you.

                         This information can eventually lead to all different tings, like a suggestion from the child to see your penis, and even see the seeds. I've heard lots of different and interesting feedback from pedophiles who've used this verbal trigger on children of this group, both girls and boys.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may start <u>any</u> conversation that involves genitals, as this subject can easily trigger the child's sexual curiosity, even arousal; all of which can make things happen for you, all by the child's own will and wishes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You can also show off your genitals, accidentally of course:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just tell the child that you got to pee, and make sure you do that in an environment where the child can easily spy on you, while being less thorough about your privacy. This will make some children curious and motivated to take a <u>closer</u> look; which is initially legal, because you're <u>formally</u> not aware of it, thus a <u>victim</u> of peeping.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, use reverse psychology by telling the child <u>not</u> to peep at you, which works pretty well on young children.
                                                  
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Peeping may become even more effective if there are more than one child involved, as they tend to become more naughty and brave in groups.

                         Suggesting sexual play to children of this group can be done with either the easy way or the hard way: 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Easy as in indirectly, when suggesting special games that begin as non-sexual games, but quickly develop into sexual; like Playing House or The Love Game <small>(v2)</small>. Or hard, as in suggesting sexual games in a direct and apparent way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="glow_green">The easy way</span> has its main advantage of being, well, easy; especially for novices. Not to mention, convenient and safe.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But a huge drawback is that the child may feel cheated, like being fooled into playing a <u>sexual</u> game that it didn't agree to play in the first place.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A consequence of this can be that the child doesn't dare to stop when things get sexual, while not liking the game at all, which can become disastrous if it afterwards decides to run back to mommy and tell what mean uncle Joe just did!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="glow_red">The hard way</span> has its main drawback by requiring some large balls of braveness, in the same time as possibly scaring the child away, especially children who don't know you that well. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The main advantage is that you're being <u>honest</u>, so the child knows from the first second what it steps into, more or less. And children <u>do</u> appreciate honesty very much.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You can also be way more assured that the child <u>really</u> wants to play the game, which can mean a genuine sexual interest.

                         <span class="glow_orange">Generally spoken</span>, there's no correct choice here, just different preferences among pedophiles. So, you will have to make your <u>own</u> decision when suggesting sexual play.

                         The easy way is a great choice when suggesting sexual play with children close to home. The hard way is a great choice for children outdoors who not know you that well or not know you at all, aka Hunting Season.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         I guess most newbies will choose the easy way, but it <u>does</u> require some experience to notice if a child suddenly seems uncomfortable or startled during a non-sexual game that develops into a sexual one. So, be <u>very</u> careful, incremental and observant when doing this.

                                   Secrecy will have to be established before <u>any</u> sexual game can begin. You may remember how to do so from the <a class="set3" href="secrecy.html" target="_blank">Secrecy chapter</a> within the Security guide.

                         I must add that a few pedophiles have actually been able to suggest sexual play with children when they have caught children red handed for masturbation. This can be an awesome way to have that first sexual activity with a child, since the child will already be aroused and all warmed up.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may then just start with the <u>second</u> activity below!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, this is only recommended with the younger half of this age group, as <u>they</u> won't be all that embarrassed by getting caught like this, contrary to the older and thus more mentally complicated children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The older children will become <u>way</u> more embarrassed, which can create some really unfortunate situations. Like, they may accept sexual play because they are in a light shock of being caught, but then regret it heavily afterwards. Or they may accept doing it just because they are afraid that you will tell on them if they don't. So be careful if you choose to exploit this situation with the older children.

                         Suggesting sexual play to children directly, is initially very basic and straight forward. But it does require some sort of finesse nevertheless, so you don't freak any children out or make them feel pressured to agree to your suggestion.
                         
                         <br />

                         And these instructions work on <u>all</u> regular children.

                         <br />
                         
                         I always recommend giving a child this suggestion <u>only</u> when it is happy and in a good mood, <u>and</u> when you already know each other well and share a basically good chemistry; the only <u>exception</u> being when hunting outdoors for unknown kids.

                         And the first part of the suggestion goes like this:
                         
                         <br />

                                   "You know what? Today I have a cool idea, which is to play a special and secret game together; a game that is very exciting. But you don't have to play it if you don't want to; that will be all up to you to decide. So, what do you think about that?"

                         <br />
                         
                         This will sound initially exciting for most children, which will seriously trigger their curiosity. You will also be showing a great deal of respect towards their own will and beings.

                         The neat thing about this phrasing however, is that the <u>older</u> children of this group will more likely understand where you're going with this question. And if they feel uncomfortable with it, it will become quite apparent in their faces and by the way they suddenly act. Some may even say no to doing it. While, those who feel <u>ready</u> for sexual play will instead become quite intrigued, which will also be easily noticed and confirmed.

                         In other words, by phrasing the suggestion like this, you will actually be able to <u>notice</u> how the older and smarter children react to this suggestion long <u>before</u> you drop the bomb and suggest <u>sexual</u> play. You may then redraw that suggestion, if you sense that they didn't appreciate it, before you make that critical move and suggest an <u>illegal</u> action.

                         Most of the younger children won't be smart enough to see through such a question. But on another hand, they will be less concerned about such games anyway, because of their natural curiosity, openness and lacking shame towards sex.

                         <u>Most</u> children will look at this as both exciting and positive. And some will ask what sort of game this is. Whether they ask about the game or not, as <u>long</u> as they seem interested and positive to the idea, you may release the nuclear bomb:

                         I know, this is a quite hardcore suggestion!

                         But it won't actually sound all that scary to most kids. And we only suggest that they <u>look</u> at it, nothing more, which is why it won't sound all that scary in the first place. Of course, we will aim for more hardcore activities, as one thing will hopefully lead to another when the game begins.

                         However, most kids don't just jump into this game right away. So, if the child seems intrigued and positive to this suggestion, but in the same time seems a little bit shy and unsure, you can add this additional insurance:

If you agree to play this special and secret game with me, you may only watch as I show you things, while <u>you</u> will be the one who decides <u>everything</u> in the game, even when to <u>stop</u> it."

                         <br />
                         
                         I recommend that you add this latter insurance <u>regardless</u> of the child being skeptical or not, as it never hurts being a little bit too careful when having sex with kids.
                         
                         <br />

                         Of course, if the child seems negative to this game after having learned what it is about, and even after that latter insurance, just tell the child that you where just kidding there, and pretend it never happened; which may sound kind of stupid, but really is the only thing you can do at that point.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child <u>still</u> seems excited and positive to your suggestion, all I can say is <u>congratulations</u>; you're now about to actually perform the <u>first</u> of the upcoming sexual activities with a child, as a pedophile, which is introducing your penis!
                                             
                         <br />

                         This is thus an <u>universal</u> suggestion that fits all children in all situations, which is easy and safe to remember and practice.

                         With regular children, we will start with the introduction of the adult genital, as it's usually best to have done this before any other sexual play begins; while these children will anyway be initially more interested in <u>your</u> genitals rather than their own. Then we'll move to <u>their</u> genitals, as they <u>do</u> enjoy showing off their own as well, and they get aroused if an adult touches them in the right way. When both of your genitals have been introduced, we can move on to genital contact, which is all about having your genitals meet and stimulate each other physically. Finally we'll try performing an oral sexual intercourse with the child; and hopefully manage to make it accept sucking you nicely and deeply, to finally ejaculate into its sweet little mouth, whether it chooses to spit the cum out afterwards or swallow all of it like a good little girl or boy.

                         I recommend starting with the first activity, and then move through all of them in the order listed above.

                         Please note that you may <u>start</u> with the second activity, depending on the initiation used and your general situation. But avoid moving to the third activity without having <u>successfully</u> completed both the first <u>and</u> second one.

                         These are basic recommendations for sexual activities with regular children, all of which should be split into different sessions with at least one day between each one, so a child won't have to deal with too much sex at once.

                         Regular children aren't as rough as the babies and toddlers, thus they need more incremental steps to digest such strong and spicy activities for the first time, so they don't become overwhelmed and traumatized.

                         However, if you find yourself in a rare situation that can't be repeated that easily, you may execute all of these activities in just one session, but with the risk of overwhelming the child.

                                   Make sure to have all clean genitals, as <a class="set3" href="swk_prep.html#hygiene_practice" target="_blank">described</a> in the latter preparation chapter. Unclean adult genitalia is usually considered as repulsive among regular children, which may cause an activity to fail miserably <u>and</u> be hard to repeat.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   These activities don't need much of strict preparations in advance, since regular children can handle these activities almost anywhere at anytime. But <u>if</u> you're able to prepare in advance, and create ideal circumstances, please do so:
                                                       
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   Use a room that is familiar to the child, ideally its own bedroom and in its regular bed, where it feels highly comfortable and is used to be less clothed or nude.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Make sure the child has a very soft and comfortable surface to lie on during the whole session, if not using a bed.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Increase the temperature of the room to above average, because being less clothed and nude can become freezing, thus uncomfortable and annoying for the child.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Sex toys, vibrators especially, are usually very exciting toys for regular children, which will help you make them seriously horny, thus make them come harder and faster.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Keep an eye on the child's behavior during these activities, and see if it ever gets uncomfortable, which makes it wise to tone things down a bit, or even stop completely.

                                   The genitals of regular children are quite rough, and can thus stand some light abuse without becoming that much irritated afterwards.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Because of the latter, lubricants aren't strictly needed when rubbing and jerking their genitals. But lubricants <u>will</u> nevertheless make any rubbing and jerking more comfortable for the children, contrary to not using it at all.

                                   Please note that even though their genitals are pretty rough, treating them carefully will always be the best thing to do, especially the highly sensitive vaginas of preschool girls.

                                   Avoid <u>any</u> sort of vaginal or anal penetration during these activities, as either requires a special technique that's reserved for another part of this handbook.

                         When the time comes to introduce your penis to a child for the very first time, it can be executed in two major ways:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You can ask the child if it wants to open your pants by itself, and take out the penis with its small and curious hands, like unwrapping a special gift. Some children will almost die of excitement while doing this, which is funny and hot to watch.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may of course help the child some if it should struggle with a hard button or zipper.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child seems unsure about opening your pants by itself, you can suggest taking it out yourself instead, while the little sweetie watches you from a safe distance with excitement in its eyes and biting on a finger.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Be patient with the child and take things <u>very</u> slowly. As soon as you start to rush things at this stage, or put any pressure onto the child, the activity may fail.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If <u>you</u> are the one who takes out your penis, just do it and unveil it to the child in open air. Pull down you pants enough for the child to study both the penis and the balls properly. Don't waggle it or try to be funny when doing it, neither pull back the foreskin at this stage, just let it hang there quietly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Don't give the child any instructions at first, just let it look at it. But you <u>may</u> suggest that the child comes closer to get a better look at it, but only if it wants to.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Seeing an adult genital for the first time as a regular child, can become just as frighting as it can become exciting. So it's best to give the child some space and time to digest this in its own way and pace, <u>before</u> suggesting anything further.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, the more brave children will be dying to <u>touch</u> it!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When the child has been looking at it for a little while, like a couple of minutes or so, you may gently tell the child that it is allowed to touch it if it wants to. And emphasize that the penis is clean and safe to be touched with its bare hands.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some children will start to touch it right away, which I guess should be pretty much okay with most of you.
                              
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                              
                         Avoid touching or caressing the child while it touches your penis, as this can become a little too much for some children, and isn't worth risking at this point.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If this is a child outdoors during Hunting Season, you may become more pushy; even force them if you want to do that. However, if this is a child more close to home, especially someone close in your life, it's best to let the child decide for now if it wants to proceed with touching or not.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child decides to touch your penis, it will most likely just push it gently with its finger at first, and quickly retract the hand. This is pretty normal behavior, and <u>their</u> way of braking this large barrier. Some children however, will be much braver, thus grab it gently and just feel it. Some of the latter kids may even squeeze it and play with it as if it was a familiar toy.

                                   As soon as you sense an erection coming, which can happen at anytime between the unveiling of the penis to having the child touching it for the first time, tell the child at once that you can make the penis larger.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This will sound harmless and funny, and it will warn the child about the erection in advance. Or else, it might freak out some if the penis suddenly enlarges itself for no apparent reason.

                         Either before or after the child touches the penis, it will most likely begin to drip of natural lubricants. When this happens, and <u>especially</u> if the child seems to be grossed out by it, discreetly wipe it off with like a paper tissue or your clothes.
                         
                         <br />

                         If the child asks what it is, tell it that they're special diamond drops that shines and make the penis look beautiful.
                         
                         <br />

                         This will make it sound both special and delicious, even make the child want to touch it and taste it; <u>just</u> by using this wording, which shows how important it is to choose the right words when communicating with children in such situations.

                         Of course, you may want to tell the child about this regardless of it asking or not. Thus optionally, don't wipe it off, so it can study it in any way it wants to.

                                   Sometimes, an oral sexual intercourse may become tempting to perform during this activity and introduction of the penis. Some kids may actually suggest hugging or kissing it; or <u>you</u> get tempted to ask them to do that when being in such a sexual and emotionally charged situation.

                                   I commonly recommend that you <u>wait</u> with oral penetrations of regular children as long as possible, as this is can become a <u>very</u> large step for an average innocent little kid to take. However, if the child seems to not mind doing it, or you simply can't resist the temptation, you are free to go against this advice and enjoy a fully sexual intercourse with the child, <u>if</u> you agree to the risks of doing that at <u>this</u> early stage.

                         Showing the child an ejaculation, and making the child become an intimate part of that, is a very special and exciting experience for the both of you.

                         However, an important decision has to be made before you do this; which is deciding if this should be done during <u>this</u> first activity and session, or reserved for <u>another</u> session, in a day or two, by <u>repeating</u> this activity from the beginning.

                         <br />
                         
                         If you're blessed with lots of these opportunities in the future with the child in question, the safest thing is to reserve this ejaculation part for a future repetition of this session.
                         
                         <br />

                         This experience is anyway not among the hardest ones for a child to handle during a first-time meeting with an adult penis, so most children should be able to handle it, if it's done exactly as described below; especially if you sense that the child seems very eager and comfortable with this activity.

                         <br />
                         
                         Tell the child that there are special seeds inside the penis that are used to make babies. And ask the child if it wants to see those seeds come out of the penis.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Based on the feedback I've gotten from other pedophiles, very few children have denied such an opportunity. Most of them have become ecstatic, and all ready to see those seeds. The older children may already know what sperm is, and will thus be even more curious about seeing it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child agrees to see the seeds, you may then ask if it wants to pull them out with its own hands. And then show the child how to do it by grabbing its little hands and giving it a quick jerkoff course. Most children will want to do this, and I promise you that it <u>will</u> be hot being jerked off by two cute and flimsy little hands of a little princess or prince.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But the child might not agree to being the one doing it; and in such chase, tell it that <u>you</u> can pull out the seeds instead. And then just jerk yourself off while the sweet little child is watching you with its large eyes of curiosity and excitement.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, before the jerking actually begins, tell the child that you will have to struggle some to get it out, to explain your moaning and grunting during the jerking and ejaculation.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And once again, avoid touching or caressing the child during the jerking, as that should be reserved for later, when the child has gotten more used to sexual activities with adults.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After you have ejaculated semen, you can tell the child that it can study the semen if it wants to, and that it is safe to touch it with its fingers and hands.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And you have now arrived at a great point of where to stop this session and call it a day for now.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may then either repeat this activity or move to the next one during any of the following days.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, you may just move to the next activity at once, regardless of having ejaculated or not. But that may become a little bit too much for some children.

                         Surprise ejaculations aren't uncommon phenomenas during first-time introductions of adult penises to sweet children. Novices, and especially young males of such, are more likely to experience this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some ejaculates uncontrollably while the child is fiddling and playing with their genitals during the first exploration; as an ejaculation can come fast, and sometimes out of the blue; even though you think you can control yourself in advance.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A few pedophiles have reported back that they actually ejaculated in mid air during this activity, meaning that they experienced a non-touch ejaculation for the first time in their lives, as in ejaculating without even being touched at all.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most pedophiles have had their sexuality suppressed most of their lives; so when they finally <u>are</u> experiencing sex with a child for the very first time, an ejaculation can strike as fast and unforgiving as lightning in a thunderstorm.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, surprise ejaculations may freak some children out, especially the younger and more easily frightened ones. Because, they aren't prepared for it and don't know what happens, so it may become a negative experience for them, which isn't good for anyone of you.

                         Therefore, it is important for you to be aware of this <u>way</u> before an activity like this is initiated for the first time.

                         If you should sense a surprise ejaculation coming while a child explores your genitals, but you're able to stop it, the best thing to do is to either go to the bathroom and ejaculate in there, or go straight for <b class="h">Showing the Seeds</b> activity.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you feel that the semen is on its way, and you can't do anything to stop it, immediately tell the child that you will now show it the seeds that make babies, which will now come out of the penis. And if there's still time, tell the child that you will have to struggle some to get it out, to explain your moaning and grunting during the ejaculation.
                         
                         <br />

                         The latter <u>may</u> cause the child to let go of the penis and retract its hands at once, which can be pretty sad. But by not informing the child before it happens, having your penis explode into a large cum shot may cause a <u>negative</u> surprise.

                         You may optionally inform the child about the seeds <u>before</u> this whole activity begins. This can either make the child even more motivated to see your penis and play with it, <u>or</u> make it uncertain about doing it at all, because it sounds scary.

                         You could always aim for a surprise ejaculation on <u>purpose</u>. Because, it <u>really</u> is hot seeing those big shocking eyes of a child when the penis suddenly starts to spit out semen hysterically while its small hands are all over it. Seeing those eyes may for some pedophiles be worth the risk.

                         Surprise ejaculations are nevertheless not recommended, unless you know the child well and generally know what you're doing as an active pedophile.

                         If this is during a Hunting Season however, and you're dealing with a onetime affair with a child whom doesn't know your real identity, you may ejaculate at anytime if you want to, without taking any precautions in advance, except for the evidence.

                         If an unknown child doesn't want to touch it, you may just jerk yourself off regardless, and make the child (or children) just see the cum shoot out of you, while you get a nice kick and relief from doing it in front of them.

                                   Squeeze the neck of your penis, which is the spot and line that separates the penis from its head, while bending the penis forwards/downwards until the point of hurting some.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This should stop most ejaculations that are about to happen.

                         Even how totally wrong this might sound to many of you, many pedophiles do actually experience impotence during sexual activities with children that involves penis play, especially during the first couple of activities and sessions.

                         If this should happen to you, <b class="h">please don't worry</b>!

                         <br />
                         
                         This is a perfectly normal phenomena among males during sexual play and intercourses, regardless of their sexual orientation and partner.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Many people look at this with a huge worry of defeat and disappointment, which are thoughts that I can perfectly understand, and even relate to personally. Yes, impotence has happened to me as well, even as a teenager.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         But, it <u>only</u> means that you where simply too nervous or tensioned to get an erection at that particular time and activity. You <u>will</u> finally get one, sometime in the future, as you gain more experience and thus learn how to better calm down and enjoy sex with another human being.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Pedophiles are especially affected by impotence, because having sex with children can become a nerve wreaking experience for many, especially when things have to be done in a hurry, and when there's a chance of getting caught.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         There is however a huge positive side to this:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Children just don't care about that! Because, they are so special, so innocent, so inexperienced, thus they don't expect you to get one. They are capable of enjoying any sexual play without any erections involved.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Be patient and stay positive, an erection will finally come!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Of course, if you're struggling with impotence as in <u>generally</u>, even when you're all by yourself, a visit to your doctor would be the appropriate thing to do.

                         Masturbating children can be a wonderful experience for both the child and the adult.

                         I will now teach you the ideal way to masturbate a child, so it becomes a warm, loving and intimate experience for the both of you, hopefully with a nice and twitchy orgasm at the end for the little sweetie of yours.

                         If this is your <u>first</u> sexual activity of the four, that's all fine. Sometimes it is the <u>child</u> who shows its genitals first instead, all of which depend on the circumstances.

                         This activity usually starts out in either of these two ways:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It happens more or less spontaneously, which usually means that the child is pulling down its pants to show you its thing, being based on either seductive behavior or a trigger by you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It happens from a suggestion by you, like suggesting to show your genitals to each other; <u>or</u> by playing any games of such, like Playing House or The Love Game <small>(v2)</small>.

                         The way this starts out will usually be based on what sort of initiation used, which can involve several different situations and games, usually a result of <u>your</u> preferred way to initiate a sexual activity in the first place.

                         As soon as a child shows you its genitalia, admire it while carefully complimenting it. Like, tell the child that it <u>really</u> has a beautiful pee-pee, and the most beautiful you've ever seen.

                         Such compliments will boost their self-esteem and motivation to show you <u>more</u> of themselves and invite you <u>further</u> into their sexual kingdom.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you're watching the child's genitals from a distance, or you feel that you're not close enough, ask the child carefully if you can take a closer look with your face. And with such permission, try coming as close as possible while looking; at least until the child begins to back away some. Just test its tolerance level, and respect it as much as possible.

                         Regardless of the child being shy or bold, after a little while of visual admire, ask the child if you may touch its legs some while looking at its pee-pee. And if you're allowed to do that, begin feeling the outer sides of the child's upper thighs, gently up and down in a loving way.

                         This sort of touching has been very effective in the field among pedophiles, as it tends to seriously arouse children, regardless of their age.

                         Try feeling its buttocks as well, as a part of <u>further</u> testing its tolerance level towards being touched at this intimate area.

                         If the child is showing its genitals by <u>only</u> pulling down the front of its pants, just feel the child outside its pants instead, as explained above.
                         
                         <br />

                         Optionally, ask the child to pull its pants even further down, so you can get a better look at its beautiful pee-pee.
                         
                         <br />

                         Most children enjoy such attention from adults, while most of them will also have their sexual curiosity and excitement seriously triggered by all this. Some may even start to shiver of excitement, which may turn them on and make them sexually aroused, and thus become much motivated to take this exciting activity <u>further</u> with you.

                         This is a great way to test those very careful and shy children, or any child for that matter whom you don't know all that well, so you can easily and quickly learn its tolerance towards touching those areas not that far away from its genitals. This will <u>also</u> prepare and warn the child that genital touching <u>may</u> happen in the near future, giving you a pretty nice prediction of how this can turn out during the next minutes, simply by watching how the child reacts to all this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And finally, we get to the point of where to ask the child if you can carefully touch its pee-pee to learn how it feels like.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, if the child has been very anxious and tensioned during this part, especially if it didn't allow you to feel its legs while looking at its genitals, you may want to stop this activity here; and then try repeating it sometime later by starting at the beginning. This will show the child that you are very gentle and someone to be trusted, which will <u>increase</u> the chances of the child <u>agreeing</u> to genital touching the next time you play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If allowed to, simply start by touching the genital area <u>carefully</u> with a flat hand, as in just stroking it gently up and down.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then transform your hand so one of your fingers goes <u>slightly</u> into the crack of the vagina, while still moving your hand up and down. Finally start rubbing the clitoris <u>very</u> gently.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With little boys, transform your hand into 2 or 3 fingers that gently and incrementally starts to jerk the penis; but <u>without</u> pulling the foreskin back, as that will hurt for some.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may try to simultaneously rub the child's anus as well, with your other hand. Though, you may want to ask for permission first, or else it may feel that things move too fast.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may either optionally or additionally give the child oral sex, as in licking its sweet little hairless vagina or penis.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Licking children genitals will be extremely hot for the both of you; especially for <u>you</u> if this is your very first taste of a child's puffy vagina or cute little penis. Tasting kiddie pussy juice, or feeling a kiddie penis grow, or even come, inside your mouth, is nothing less than a stellar experience for a pedophile.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just ask for permission to gently <u>kiss</u> it's pee-pee.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The idea of having their genitals kissed and licked shouldn't be all that scary for most children, some will even look at it as funny, thus this should be safe to ask in most occasions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, now it would be wise to also suggest that the child lays down on its back on a comfortable surface, so you can much easier and more conveniently access its genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If allowed to, start by kissing and licking its inner thighs <u>only</u>, which will tease the child's sexuality and arousal, while in the same time doing this in an incremental and assuring way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then move to the child's genitals, and just <u>carefully</u> kiss it, before starting to use your tongue, and eventually eating it.
                         
                         <br />

                         Regardless of masturbating the child or giving it oral sex:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Do this continuously and consistently, while additionally starting to caress the child's body increasingly all over.

                         The child may become sexually aroused by all this, or it won't.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If it got a strong libido, or feels very calm and secure when doing this with you, sexual arousal is next to inevitable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If it's more or less asexual, or is tensioned and not fully comfortable with it, sexual arousal will most likely not happen.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But <u>always</u> remember that even though if children don't get sexually aroused during sexual activities with adults, they may still get a very positive experience from it. Such activities are usually very exciting in general, which stimulates their sexual curiosity. They will additionally feel warm, special and loved while getting a lot of adult attention and nice compliments. And having a tongue licking a sensitive area such as their genitals, can also make it tickle in a very interesting way, making them laugh, and thus getting a fun experience too.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         You may also use some lubricants and sex toys while masturbating the child, ideally towards the end of the session when you've got full permission to masturbate it. Most children should look at either as additionally interesting.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Just let them investigate and play some with the sex toys before applying them onto their genitals. And of course, always ask for permission before you do it.

                         These are just basic advices that you can apply to almost any situation where the child shows you its genitals, so you can make an honest attempt to touch it and masturbate it.

                         When you're masturbating children like this, especially the younger ones, several may suddenly experience strong sexual arousal for the <u>very</u> first time in their lives. And this can become a frightening experience for some.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If a child suddenly looks concerned, and starts to breathe faster and heavier, even makes some light weeps and biting on its fingers, while you're masturbating it consistently, switch your position so you can hold your arms <u>around</u> the child while continuing to masturbate it. You're free to cuddle some, hug it, kiss its cheeks, and etc. Optionally, whisper into its ear that everything is okay, this isn't dangerous, this feels nice, and that she or he is all safe right there in your arms.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may do all this <u>regardless</u>, just to be on the safe side.

                         If the child suddenly begins to resist or fight you when masturbating it, and this happens in the middle of the activity, it is almost <u>certainly</u> due to the fear of approaching its very first orgasm. When this happens, you'll have to decide if you want to stop and let the child go, or force it through its very first orgasm, which is described within the <a href="swk_prep.html#a_childs_first_orgasm" target="_blank"><span style="color:blue"><u>preparations chapter</u></span></a>.

                         You have now arrived at the section of where your genitals are about to meet. This means that the child will now for the first time experience a sexual activity that is very similar to true lovemaking, except for a genital penetration of course, which may be <u>your</u> first experience of such as well

                         This activity will become a strong sexual experience for most children, while triggering their sexual curiosity and arousal in almost <u>all</u> aspects.
                         
                         <br />

                         Before you engage this activity however, I highly recommend that you've already and successfully completed the first two. This will make this activity go much smoother, since you've already initiated a sexual relationship. If this isn't the case, this activity may not work out as described nor intended.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It is recommended to perform this activity in a bed, while the child is lying comfortably on its back and you are sitting on your knees in front of it, while the both of you are all nude.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This activity will be a semi sexual intercourse through rubbing and squashing your genitals together, thus synthetic lubricants might come in handy. You can't take for granted that your own genitals will become wet enough naturally.
                         
                         <br />

                         But we <u>will</u> do our very best making the little brat horny, and therefore start this activity by <u>slowly</u> undressing the child nude, in a caring and stroking way. Use a lot of time to undress it, while stroking your hands all over its body, except for its genitals. This will provoke the child's instinctive erotic emotions; hopefully make it sexually aroused along the way.

                         As soon as the child has become all nude, start to undress yourself as well, all nude and in front of the child. This will further make it exciting and erotic for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, if you're not able to undress yourselves all nude, like when being in an environment or a situation where full nudity doesn't feel comfortable, start the activity by touching and stroking the child's body <u>outside</u> its clothes; and of course, not yet at its genitals. This will have the approximately same effect as the latter. And then undress yourself <u>slowly</u>, first the child and then yourself, and only as much as you're comfortable with; like only pulling your pants down to your knees or feet, and lifting up your sweaters or shirts some.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you like to, your next move <u>can</u> be to masturbate the child in the same way as described in the second activity. But it's wise <u>not</u> to masturbate it all the way through an orgasm, as the child may after its orgasm feel that the game is over, or loose any further interest for it because of the relief. The best thing would therefore be to masturbate it so it gets aroused and motivated for sex, ideally almost to an orgasm, and then continue with <u>this</u> activity. This should make the both of you pretty wet as well, thus not needing any synthetic lube.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Masturbation in this regard does also mean that you may of course lick and suck the child all over its genitals and bum. This should really ignite that spark of sexuality within that slim and innocent little body that you have there in front of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may skip the masturbation part, especially if you don't have that much of time to perform this activity; and thus start it by smearing some synthetic lube onto your genitals, at least the child's, and make it ready for this session.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As already mentioned, it's best to have the child lying on its back in a bed while you sit in front of it on your knees.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may then lift the child's feet and legs up a little bit, push your penis down and onto its genitals, and enclose its thighs around your erected penis. And when ready, you may slowly and gently begin fucking the kid into its crotch.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may have to ask the child to squeeze its thighs harder together, as that will feel better for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Another nice position is to lie down in the bed and turn yourself over to one side, and then have the child lay down in front of you with its back toward you. By crouching together like a ball, you can hold the child tightly from behind, squeeze your penis through its inner thighs and into its crotch, and do the same thing in that position. You will now have better access to its face, while being able to lock and squeeze the child's legs tighter together with your own legs. And this position will become <u>way</u> more physically close, intimate and erotic.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You can also sit in a comfy chair and make the child sit on your lap and hip. You may then crouch yourself together and do the same thing as the latter, when laying sideways in bed; the only difference being that you now sit upright instead. Use your hips to move your cock into the child's crotch, while squeezing those sexy kiddie legs together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The latter two positions require that the child is comfortable with such closeness and intimacy with you, so you may have to reserve it for another similar session in the future if the child needs more time to become comfortable with this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You should anyway try to <u>eventually</u> become such close and intimate, as it will really benefit your sexual relationship.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The last option is to do it doggy style. You will soft fuck the child from behind, through the same method of placing your penis into its crotch while squeezing those legs together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Personally, I don't like doggy positions, as they're so cold and less intimate. But they can be funny to perform; and they do give you a nice view, being a slut of a kid standing on its knees in front of you, like a cheap whore in a cheap motel.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Anyway, this position does actually make the genital friction even better and easier than any previous.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These are the most used and most efficient soft fucking positions that I recommend using. But don't be afraid of experimenting with different positions yourself.
                         
                         <br />

                         Why not having the child using its own hands to rub your cock against its genitalia or butt?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Use whatever position, surface or prop you like for this activity, as long as you successfully accomplish fucking the kid into its enclosed crotch.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Children girls will get a nice and wet stimulation of their clitoris and outer vagina (labia), and the boys will have all their genitals being stimulated in the same way, while <u>you</u> will have your stiff and wet penis glide into this wet crack, in and out. Together you will experience sexual arousal and enjoyment, while bonding socially and emotionally in quite special ways.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, you should be more gentle with the boys during this activity, as you can easily squash their testicles, which hurts.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Also be careful with the girls if you get very excited and increase the speed of this soft fucking, as you can quickly slam into their vaginas by mistake, which will hurt a lot.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is a very nice activity, whether being done with little girls or little boys. It has very nice and comfortable positions for the child to be in, while <u>your</u> positions will give you lots of control over the situation. It will be the approximately same positions as of regular sexual intercourses, which will additionally teach and prepare the child for <u>that</u> exactly.

                         Being blown by a regular child is simply too extraordinary for description. They've now reached an age of which they are highly capable of taking large adult males pretty far into their mouths, even those with small doll mouths, while still being so tiny and cute as all children are. It's just awesome!
                         
                         <br />

                         However, and as with all humans, oral sex isn't for everyone. And with regular children, it <u>can</u> become pretty difficult convincing them to do this willingly and have them enjoying it.

                         They are gradually becoming more picky about yucky things, at least what <u>they</u> think is yucky. And an adult male penis that drips of precum can easily fall into that category.

                         These children will <u>also</u> be those who'll most likely accept or even enjoy getting a large ejaculation of semen into their mouths during the intercourse.

                         So, as you can see, there <u>are</u> plenty of regular children out there who <u>will</u> agree to giving you some decent oral sex. Unfortunately, these children don't represent the majority of children out there, so the odds of meeting one isn't all high.

                         But this won't stop us from at least <u>trying</u>!

                         I always recommend that a regular child experiences its first oral intercourse with an adult male <u>after</u> having already completed the latter three activities with complete success, also including semen ejaculations. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This will make it accumulated with sexual play, adult penises, and semen ejaculations, <u>before</u> getting an adult male inside itself for the first time, which will highly increase the likelihood of first-time success.

                         I also recommend combining this activity with masturbation, as that may make the child sexually aroused, so it becomes less afraid of and more motivated to get an adult male far into its mouth; even accept and swallow a large load of cum.
                         
                         <br />

                         But you may of course perform this activity as standalone, especially if you're about to be sucked by children spontaneously, like having very little time to complete the activity or being outdoors and hunting for kiddies.

                                   Children <u>love</u> approvals and compliments from adults whom they trust and respect, so don't forget making them feel skillful and special as soon as they start to lick your penis or let it inside their red little mouths.

                                   Perform the first oral intercourse <u>very</u> incrementally; and try finding the child's threshold, like when it starts to gag or seem uncomfortable. When a threshold is established, you may fuck the child's mouth consistently, but not too fast <u>nor</u> too hard.

                                   Sperm was never meant to be eaten, so it doesn't taste well. And since most regular children are <u>very</u> sensitive towards bitter tastes, most won't be comfortable with oral ejaculations; some may even freak out when it happens, and thus <u>never</u> want to to do it again. So, be careful about this.

                                   The group of children whom you can safely ejaculate into without any warnings in advance, are those of onetime affairs when hunting outdoors. Their reactions become more or less irrelevant since you won't be seeing them again. You may want to hold their heads firmly in place when you ejaculate, if you want to make <u>sure</u> that they can't escape your cock when it explodes. However, the latter may cause some of them to bite it, which may traumatize your genital at various levels.

                                   Whenever you're unsure, and especially when the child is a close and longterm lover of yours, ejaculate outside the child's mouth and avoid hitting its face with semen. You may of course try ejaculating into the child's mouth during future sessions, after some further practice and experimentations.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   You may want to consider <u>not</u> being too far into the child's mouth if you <u>do</u> decide to ejaculate into it, or else it will feel like choking, and thus dislike what's happening.

                                   I commonly recommend to <u>not</u> talk about oral sex in advance of this session when dealing with regular children, but instead just let it happen naturally as described below. If you ask them in advance to suck your cock, and they don't appreciate that idea, this activity will most likely fail miserably.

                         Have the child lying down on its back in front of you, rotated 90 degrees to the left, while ideally being nude. Make sure that its head and your penis are at the same height, and have your penis in front of it with about 1 foot of distance.
                         
                         <br />

                         It's head should now be conveniently in front of your penis while its genitals should be easily reachable with your right hand; a very nice position for this activity, for the both of you.

                         Use your right hand to gently masturbate the child, and use your left hand to simultaneously caress its face while gently and slowly rubbing its lips with your thumb.

                         Most human beings get an urge to use their mouths for sexual activities when being aroused, which of course includes regular children. If the child in question reacts erotically or sexually to having its mouth and lips fiddled with during this part of the activity, or best of all starts licking or sucking on your thumb, it clearly indicates that it is initially ready and motivated for an oral intercourse.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may optionally try moving your thumb inside the child's mouth some, to see how acceptant it is towards oral play.
                         
                         <br />

                         We will try using the child's sexual arousal to our advantage; so as soon as you notice any physical behavior of such, <u>slowly</u> approach its face with your penis, while caressing it.

                         The child will now be way more acceptant and tolerant towards an oral penetration of a large and wet adult male.

                                   Unlike babies and toddlers, regular children almost <u>require</u> to become sexually aroused for this <u>direct</u> oral penetration attempt to succeed with best possible odds.

                         If the child either don't face your penis <u>or</u> turns its face away when it approaches, don't use your hand or any verbal commands to force the child to face it. Just let the penis gently and barely touch its cheeks, while keeping on stroking its face with your hand in a loving way. Try rubbing your penis head over the child's face or lips without annoying it too much, and make your penis cuddle with the child's cute face, as this might gradually motivate it to finally start sucking you.

                         If it seems totally uncomfortable by having your penis coming closer to its face, move it back and away from its face again, while keeping on caressing its head and lips. And make a few more attempts, as slowly and gently as possible.

You may optionally try moving its head towards it in a gentle and motivating way, while still caressing its face and head.

                         When the child finally faces your penis with its small red lips, and you're ready to try penetrating it for the first time and become its first male, keep on caressing its face while slowly and gently pushing your penis head towards its lips.

                         You may gently and kindly suggest opening its mouth:

                         As soon as the mouth opens, push your penis head only halfway inside it, and then out again. And keep on repeating this for a half minute or so.

                         If the child seems to accept it, start moving your penis some further inside, like your whole penis head, by using the same technique; and do that for another half minute or so.
                         
                         <br />

                         Finally begin the intercourse by gently moving in and out, without getting all the way out of its mouth.
                         
                         <br />

                         The child's head should rest, either on a surface or within your hands, while <u>you</u> control the penis in and out of its mouth by moving your hips.
                         
                         <br />

                         And you're now actually <u>fucking</u> a little brat!

                         Just keep on fucking that sweet little brat of yours, slowly and repeatedly, in and out, as long as it accepts what's happening and seems comfortable enough to <u>complete</u> the intercourse.

                         <br />
                         
                         If the child is very aroused, or seems very acceptant to be fucked orally, you may get a little more rougher, by speeding things up a bit while going even deeper.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Try avoiding the child from getting an orgasm while it sucks you, and try to trigger one when you feel an ejaculation is coming and you want to come into its mouth.
                                                            
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will almost be like operating a machine, which all-in-all requires a lot of practice, including learning the child's sexuality better to know, so you can time things well and make this activity work in the best way possible for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The ideal thing to happen is that you come inside its mouth either when it is very close to an orgasm or in the middle of one. Most children will then suck you as deep as an old well, and swallow anything you give them orally, without hesitating, while enjoying it enormously.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It will be additionally arousing for the child to suck on something wet and large with its mouth when being aroused, as the human mouth <u>is</u> after all an erogenous zone.

                         This is a well-used technique among professional child lovers to make children <u>very</u> motivated to suck you. Because, they will <u>want</u> to be sexually stimulated, but that can only happen if they suck your cock deeply and swallow all your semen.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This can become a torturous experience for the children, but not in any painful way. It will be pure torture of pure sexual lust, with an unmatched relief for the both of you at the end.
                         
                         <br />

                         Some children have actually ended up crying out loudly of pure horniness during such sessions, and shivering for an hour or so after it has been successfully completed.

                         Though, this technique does <u>only</u> work on aroused children, and especially on children with strong libidos who get very horny very easily, and being capable of getting hard orgasms.

                         Tie the child's hands, either to the bed poles or behind its back, so it can't reach its own genitals. But make sure to tie them in a comfortable way, and only if she or he agrees to it.

                         As soon as the child becomes sexually aroused, move your penis towards its face. Then <u>stop</u> the masturbation as soon as your penis makes contact with the child's face in one way or another, and <u>only</u> continue masturbating the child when it licks or sucks your penis in a way that pleases you in an acceptable way. Stop once again as soon as it spits it out.

                         You may optionally tell the child to open its mouth and suck your genital, and that you will only continue touching its genitals when it sucks you nicely.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Regardless of which, the child should eventually realize that sucking your cock is the <u>only</u> way to feel good and get that nice orgasm at the end.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you manage to <u>really</u> arouse the child, the child will eventually become CRAAAZY motivated to suck your cock. Because, you will refuse the child an orgasm until you have ejaculated inside its mouth. And this can take some time, which can cause a lot of sexual torture for the child.

                         And as soon as it has swallowed every single drop of your cum, and licked your penis and balls all clean, you can give the little sweetie its long overdue orgasm.

                         When trying to practice a first-time oral intercourse with a regular child <u>without</u> combining it with arousal, you will have to exploit its curiosity instead, along with any possible weakness as already <a class="set3" href="#link1" target="_blank">described</a> in the former gray list box. Though, some may already be aroused or quickly become so during <u>these</u> activities anyway, depending on the child and situation.

                         If you're doing this as the very <u>first</u> sexual activity between the two of you, which I don't recommend doing, but you might not want to listen to boring old me, at least <u>quickly</u> perform the <a class="set3" href="#introducing_the_penis" target="_blank">Introducing the Penis</a> activity first; if you're able to.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Little Elmo just told me how beautiful you are, and he likes you so much that he wants to kiss you."
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;

                         Most children will think of this as quite funny, which should cause them to smile or even giggle some, especially the younger ones of this group who feel comfortable while being with you in such an intimate and special situation.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Other children may not seem to take it as funny, but still become very curious about it, even become sexually aroused. Experienced pedophiles can quickly determine this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now, don't panic nor become disappointed if the kid says "ew!" and giggles. Two common mistakes done by inexperienced pedophiles in such scenarios are either to try forcing the child to do it, or just give up in a self-pity defeat.

                         Just stay cool and funny as ever, and keep on talking the child into doing it, with lots of calm and patience:

                         Theatrical stuff like this can become hilarious for many kids, whether they're young preschoolers or late elementary. Some may even feel truly sorry for poor little Elmo! So, just keep on doing this, talking on Elmo's behalf in a funny way, <u>while</u> staying cool and funny. Elmo might <u>finally</u> get a kiss, you see!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If Elmo doesn't get a kiss, eventually put him inside your pants again while <u>still</u> staying in a happy and positive mood; as in <u>not</u> giving the child any guilty feelings for not having complied to your suggestion. The child will then have something to think about, which may cause it to redecide sometime later.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Or, you may just repeat this attempt in any future session.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child seems totally unwilling to kiss it, or grossed out by your suggestion, especially after several attempts, this child will most likely <u>not</u> be the one who will do it <u>willingly</u>. You can then try the next Daring and Bribes method as an alternative, and see if <u>that</u> gets you anywhere with this reluctant kid.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If Elmo finally <u>gets</u> a kiss, especially on the child's mouth, you can try turning up the heat some and take it one level up:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Oh, that was <u>so</u> nice! And <u>that</u> wasn't dangerous, was it?
                                                            
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may optionally ask the child for more kisses, so it gets increasingly used to your penis touching its face or lips.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then lets try moving this game up a notch:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Well, now Elmo wants to be licked some. He just <u>loves</u> getting licked! Can you pretend being a little puppy dog who licks him just a little bit? He would <u>really</u> appreciate that!"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Or anything similar, so you'll get the kid to lick your penis.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may have to do some more convincing and begging, on Elmo's behalf, in the usual cool and funny way, as described.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And as always, optionally repeat this licking, while trying to increase it, so the child gets increasingly used to touch your penis more intimately with its lips and tongue.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And finally, try making the kid suck you:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Do you know what? You have now made Elmo more happy than it has ever been in his <u>whole</u> life! If you could only see the smile on his face right now!"
                         
                              </div>

                                   "But, Elmo also enjoys being sucked on, just like an ice cream. Maybe you could show Elmo how you enjoy lollipops, by licking and sucking on him with your beautiful mouth?"
                         
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         If Elmo becomes fortunate enough to become a kid's lollipop, you may additionally suggest stuff while the child sucks it; like telling it how to suck it better, see how far it can go inside the it's mouth, see how long it can suck it at a time, and etc.

                         If you're doing this with a group of children, especially boys, try making this into a <u>competition</u>; like who can suck it the best, deepest, for the longest durations, and etc. And finally, who <u>dares</u> to get baby seeds into its mouth?
                         
                         <br />

                         It's important when dealing with regular children to use humor when trying to make them suck you as a <u>standalone</u> activity. This will create a nice and cool atmosphere, while motivating them to become a little bit CRAAAZY during the process. Regular children just <u>love</u> going all crazy, especially in groups.
                         
                         <br />

                         They may even <u>enjoy</u> this from the start, and do it willingly and easily without much of convincing nor acting from your part.
                         
                         <br />

                         However, many pedophiles experience a potential problem during this activity, which is that some children tend to stop after not so long. You may ask them to do it longer, but that may not work if they think that they've had enough for now.

                         A few pedophiles become desperate in such scenarios, which sometimes can lead to force and rape, which again usually leads to the police station, and jail finally.

                         Unless of course, this is a part of your Hunting Season, and you're dealing with a stranger kid. Force can then be much more safely put into practice.

                         If this happens, try first to make them jerk you off, like executing the <a class="set3" href="#showing_the_seeds" target="_blank">Showing the Seeds</a> activity. Or, just jerk yourself off in front of them while they watch you closely. You may also go for the next Daring and Bribes method:

                         Actually, many children <u>do</u> take such dares seriously; especially <u>boys</u>, and most children in groups. They just don't feel comfortable as <u>cowards</u>, and they always have this need and want to prove themselves and be worthy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         So, some of these children may just end up giving you a nice and deep blowjob, just to prove you (and Elmo) wrong.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, by daring them like this, you may talk them into doing something that they <u>might</u> regret or feel uncomfortable with later, which will increase the risk of having them feel sexually abused and molested afterwards. This can cause negative consequences for the both of you, at various levels, which is why I usually recommend doing this on unknown children during Hunting Seasons.

                         If the child finally kisses it, you may continue daring it to lick it, and finally suck it, in the approximately same way as above.

                         <b class="h">Bribes</b> are also effective, and can be considered as prostitution in many ways. Thus, you may also try turning a regular child into a true whore by teasing it with candy:

                         <br />
                    
                         And then continue, if the child complies, with licking and sucking. And just keep on giving the child caramels, or candy of any sort, as treats and payment, while things develop.

                         You may of course use money instead, especially if you're dealing with older children. And the more things they do, and the more hardcore it gets, the more money you give them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         And of course, you may here as well emphasize that it's not dangerous at all to kiss it, that Elmo is all clean and smells like flowers, and etc. You may also have to work a little bit to convince them to do all this, as already described.
                         
                         <br />

                         You should definitely show the candy in advance, wrapped inside glossy paper, like tempting a hungry little fish with a shiny lure. And the same, of course, goes for the money.

                         This section will go through the most popular sex activities with regular children that aren't based on sexual initiations, thus they can be immediately performed on any child at anywhere.
                         
                         <br />

                         These activities are <u>initially</u> very light, and thus very safe and comfortable to perform for those of you who aren't yet ready for true initiations of true sexual relationships with children. This allows you to use way more discreet and careful ways to experience sex with children if you're having difficulties braking that first barrier. And they're highly adjustable as well, so <u>you</u> can decide the strength and length of these activities.

                         These activities are also relevant for professional pedophiles who want some additional ideas and games to play.

                         <br />
                         
                         When the children become approximately 5 years of age, they enter the famous <span class="glow_red">kissing stage</span>. This sudden interest for kissing continues throughout childhood, and will gradually develop into tongue kissing and general wet mouth play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A fortunate property with regular kids is that they aren't that picky about <u>whom</u> they kiss, and they don't need a specific reason for doing it in the first place. They just enjoy doing it because it makes their whole bodies tickle of excitement.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, the children must like you and feel comfortable towards you before this activity can become successful.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, the younger the children, the easier this becomes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Making out with attractive children as a genuine pedophile can become extremely hot. And this activity makes it possible for you to jerk yourself off discreetly while performing it, potentially making it a pretty hot sexual activity in the same time as being pretty safe and comfortable to perform.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It can also be combined with gentle touching and stroking, which can actually trigger the child's sexuality even further, causing the game to develop into true sexual play in a very natural and comfortable way for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />

                         This activity is <u>initially</u> a fully legal and non-sexual activity that you can perform on any child of yours, regardless of gender. But it has the <u>potential</u> of becoming more intimate and physical, even fully sexual, if the circumstances are ideal and the both of you allow for that to happen.

                                   It is highly recommended to perform this activity at a secret and private location, as this will be the safest and most exciting thing to do for the both of you; like having a secret place where you play the kissing game. This is also advantageous if the game should develop into a sexual game, which sometimes can happen spontaneously and quickly.

                                   Make sure that you've got a nice breath in advance; brush your teeth and use dental floss and mouthwash in advance. Additionally, thew on a nice tasting bubblegum for a couple of minutes in advance, which will make you taste like <u>candy</u>.
                                        
                              </div>

                         As you can see, this activity doesn't require much of preparations, even if it should develop into a sexual game. You can therefore perform it almost anywhere with any child, as long as you're private and alone together.
                         
                         <br />

                         This activity <u>may</u> seem a little bit frighting for the absolute beginners, as you'll now have to <u>suggest</u> playing the kissing game with a certain child of yours. But, we will do it as carefully and gently as possible:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Do you want to play a very cool game with me?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                    
                         I can't imagine that any child would say no to this, hence:
                    
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         <br />
                         
                         *kaboom*
                    
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, this isn't as scary as it might seem like, as most regular children won't initially look at this suggestion as anything malicious nor sexual.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, some <u>may</u> look at it as a little bit frighting, because it will feel like a very intimate and unusual game to play. Others may become embarrassed, but usually in a good way. Regardless of which, most will just smile some and become unsure in a very cute way; and you will need to convince them in a careful way that this isn't dangerous to play at all, <u>and</u> that you will play it <u>very</u> carefully.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And there are those who think it is yucky-yucky-yucky:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                    
                         <div class="quote_child">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Eww, that's gross!"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you know each other well, or the child has a brave and outgoing personality, or it is depended on you and your presence in its life, especially if it has a childish crush on you, the child <u>will</u> play this game with you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, picking the right child for this suggestion and game is obviously important if you want to succeed.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Picking the right child does however require some experience. But always remember that experience can only be acquired through trials and errors.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child agrees to play this game with you, whether being all enthusiastic or just partially, tell the child that you'll be playing this game at a secret location, so no one can see you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will establish some kind of initial secrecy, thus make most children immediately understand that they can't tell about this to anyone. But you might want to additionally tell the child with <u>words</u> that this has to be a secret, especially if you're dealing with a preschooler or first-grader.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such a secret location could be in a basement, in an attic, inside or behind a garden shed, or at a hidden and private spot in the woods, depending on the circumstances.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         By doing this at a special and unusual location, you will also accomplish making this game more exciting and enticing for the both of you, especially for the child.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's usually best to sit down on a comfortable surface, and then ask the child to come and sit on your lap, facing you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child is too old to sit on your lap, or it feels inappropriate, you may sit down on your knees while facing each other.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Initiate the game by telling the child that you will start carefully with just a <u>tiny</u> kiss at first, and ask the child if it wants to have its eyes opened or closed.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The first kiss should <u>only</u> be just <u>one</u> quick and dry kiss on the child's lips; and right afterwards:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Cool! That wasn't any dangerous, was it?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now you can ask the child if you can kiss two times in a row; and simply repeat the latter, two times.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then ask the child to kiss three times in a row, while still giving short and dry kisses.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As you may see, we're doing this <u>very</u> light and incrementally, so the child gets a nice first impression of real kissing, being just simple and dry, thus harmless and delicate.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A great <b class="h">next step</b> from there would be to ask the child if you can kiss a <u>long</u> kiss. And then repeat the first kiss, but stick your lips to the child's lips for a longer amount of time. About 5 seconds or so should be a nice and careful start.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And then ask for even longer kisses, like 10 seconds or so.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most children who kiss for the first time will have very stiff and rigid lips. So, if you want to teach the child how to kiss properly, ask it to loosen up its mouth some, like making a pout. You may additionally ask the child to lick around its lips some, so they become wet and delicious for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, you may not want to lick your own lips just yet, as the child <u>may</u> look at that as gross.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child seems comfortable with this activity and things have gone well so far, the next step is to suggest tongue play, as in asking if your tongues can meet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just like the first kiss, start with just <u>one</u> quick collision with your tongues. Then increase the amount of collisions in a row. And finally, suggest longer collisions, and eventually playing around some with your tongues.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just make it as incremental as the first part of the kissing.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you've been successfully playing with your tongues, and the child is <u>still</u> comfortable with this activity, you may finally suggest French Kissing. That means a regular kiss, but in the same time as you play with your tongues, inside your mouths.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         While doing all this, you may optionally ask the child to lay its arms around your neck, to make it more intimate and arousing for the both of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also and optionally touch and stroke the child up and down at each side of its upper body, as this may trigger some sexual arousal within the child, <u>which</u> may cause the child to suggest sexual play in one way or another.

                         But any of those latter two suggestions <u>may</u> cause the child to feel discomfort, so it's usually wise to only perform them if the child seems <u>very</u> comfortable with this activity as a whole.
                         
                         <br />

                         Also note that this whole activity may of course be split into several sessions over several days, if you feel like it. Maybe the child is very quite and shy, or you don't know each other that well yet, all of which would make splitting sensible and wise. A wise place to split would be between regular kissing and tongue kissing; and maybe another split between regular tongue kissing and having your arms around each other while stroking the child's upper body.

                         If you feel brave enough, you may start to feel the child at other places as well, outside its clothes. But be <u>very</u> careful and incremental with that, and gently feel your way through it.

                         One game that most preschoolers and early elementary schoolers love playing, and do play a lot, is playing house. Such games are very popular among these kiddies, because they've now entered an age and development stage where gender and sexual oriented play becomes highly interesting.

                         Mid to late elementary schoolers do also play these games, but not as much as they did at their earlier stages. However, the oldest children of this group <u>do</u> find it interesting playing such games with adults(!), which can quickly, easily and safely be steered towards erotic and sexually oriented play.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Playing house is basically all about pretending to be adults in an everyday situation. The roles usually consist of a mother and a father, usually being played by a female and male child. And of course, children roles as well, whether being other children or just dolls.

                         They try to emulate the life of adulthood in various ways at various levels; and some kids go pretty far to emulate this, which includes marriage, kissing and even making babies.

                         Playing House is therefore the game among children that most often leads to sexual play between them; which is something that pedophiles can and should exploit.

                         We will now try to make a child play such a game with you, while <u>you</u> control the game, so it becomes <u>very</u> interesting and exciting, and hopefully <u>arousing</u>, for the child to play.

                         But of course, you will only control the game <u>indirectly</u>, so we give the child a false sense of being the one who's in control, which will make little her or him feel most comfortable.

                                   This game <u>should</u> be played at a private location where you can be all alone and undisturbed with the child. This will make it comfortable for you as the adult, as there are some special parts of this game that others shouldn't see.

                                   And of course, such games <u>might</u> develop into sexual and illegal activities, which obviously require privacy anyway.

                                   However, it <u>can</u> be played at a location where there are other adults around <u>if</u> you're left with no other choices. But you <u>must</u> be temporarily hidden from the others when the special parts of the game are being executed, like being <u>inside</u> your 'house'. And the game will then have to stay legal until you are all alone with the child for a decent period of time.

                                   You will need a 'house' that you and your new 'wife' can move into and live inside. And you will need a baby doll, ideally several small dolls, that will fit underneath the child's t-shirt or sweater. Stuffed animals are also welcome to the 'family', as most real families do have dogs and cats as well.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   It is however recommended that you build the new house along with the child, as this will become very fun and make the child even more engaged when the game begins for real.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   You will also need two (toy/paper) rings.

                                   If you want to ejaculate into your pants during the game, without the child noticing it, or you just want to be prepared for that, just in case, strap a condom on in advance.

                                   If you want the game to become sexual, or if you want to be prepared for that as well, have some clinex/paper cloths in your pocket to wipe cum.

                                   Make sure that you are <u>all</u> clean and smell <u>all</u> nice before the game starts, as it <u>will</u> become intimate, regardless.

                         It all begins with suggesting to play house with the child, and further suggest that <u>you</u> will be the father and the <u>child</u> will be the mother of your new family.
                         
                         <br />

                         This is very simple and easy to do, so just do it in your own preferred way.

                         <br />
                         
                         This game will conflict with <u>some</u> combinations of genders, like if you're a gay pedophile with a little boy. You may still suggest that the boy can be the mother; <u>or</u> suggest that your family will have two fathers, and the child will be a <u>special</u> father who can have babies. The latter usually works well.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This game is therefore ideal for male pedophiles with little girls, but <u>can</u> be modified as long as the child agrees to it.
                         
                         <br />

                         When you're ready to start the game, tell the child:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Building such a house will be much fun, and it can be really simple; unless you already have a little playhouse or play tent. You may e.g. just throw a large bed sheet over a living room table, or four chairs, as long as there's enough room inside to fit the both of you while sitting down. A nice and clean storage room does also work well as a house.

                         As for furnitures for your new home, you only need a box that represents a kitchen table, and some bed sheets and pillows. It would be ideal to additionally have some plastic dishes and cups for that kitchen table, and a baby bottle for the baby.

                         Already now, during the building of a private and cozy 'home', most regular children will instinctively feel a sexual tension inside themselves. This isn't sexual arousal initially, but more like exciting expectations towards playing a <u>sexualized</u> game. And playing such a game with a sexually experienced adult, will make it even more exciting for the children, especially the older ones of this group.

                         This can be done in a very simple and quick matter if you like: just take out the rings and put one ring on the child's finger, and one on your own. And tell the child that as soon as you either kiss or hug, you will become married. And the child can decide if it wants to kiss <u>or</u> hug.
                         
                         <br />

                         This will give the child a choice, as in <u>control</u> of the most critical and sensitive parts of the game, thus making it feel safe and comfortable while playing it.

                         If the child doesn't want to get married, you can say that it is all fine creating a family <u>without</u> being married, because many adults do that as well.

                         Most kids will be <u>ecstatic</u> at this point, especially little girls at the early to mid stage of this group, who are <u>very</u> curious about babies and births.

                         If the child doesn't want to make a baby at this point, it's usually a sign of something not being right. It would probably be best to either ask the child how she or he wants to play the game instead, or just stop the game all together, as either would be your <u>safest</u> option in such a situation.

                         A few children may be a little bit skeptical to getting under a duvet to make babies, even though all clothes will stay on. But please stay super patient, and give the child lots of time and room to make that decision.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you sense that the child is <u>really</u> skeptical to this, you may tell the child that a baby can also me made on pretend by hugging each other one time; which can be considered as the first step of this play, as the child might <u>eventually</u> do this bed thing with you another time you play this again.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child doesn't even want to hug you, we get back to that sign again, of something <u>not</u> being right. This will force you to make some important decisions, as already explained.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child consents, gently lead it to the bed and get under the duvet together. Lay down on your back, and have the child lie on the top of you, face to face. Then just start rubbing your bodies and crouches towards each other, by showing the child how to do it correctly first.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally tell the child that <u>this</u> is how we make babies; almost. And tell that you have to do this for a certain amount of time for the baby to get successfully created.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may use other positions if you like. But, by having the child lying on the <u>top</u> of you, it will feel way more in control, and thus way more safe and comfortable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also and <u>optionally</u> caress and touch the child all around its body, except for its private parts. You may even suggest kissing while doing this. But either will more likely concern or even freak the child out, so be careful with this.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Nevertheless, you may want to find a position where you can masturbate yourself in hide while doing this, as that will make the game pretty hot for <u>you</u>!
                         
                         <br />

                         Most children will look at this as <u>super</u> exciting: not only do they play a sexually oriented game that they generally love to play at this age group, but <u>this</u> sort of play will additionally stimulate their intellectual and sexual curiosities towards sex and pregnancy; which brings us to something important:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Even though you're now playing the softcore edition of this game, which means no undressing, the child's sexuality and arousal may <u>still</u> be triggered enough for it to actually <u>suggest</u> sexual play in one way or another. So, be prepared!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="link2"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         After a few minutes of intimate rubbing, and hopefully kissing, you can stop the baby making act and put a baby doll underneath the child's sweater. Then say that the baby is now created and is growing inside the child's tummy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Tell the child that it can give birth to the baby whenever it feels like. And when that happens, make it lie down on the floor, on its back, so the baby can can be delivered to you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When the child is giving birth, just simulate a birth by slowly taking the baby out of the child's sweater, at the bottom part.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And from that point, you can just continue playing the game, by letting the <u>child</u> decide most other aspects of the play, while it takes care of the baby. Let the child push you around some and tell you what to do, while carefully steering the play in the direction you want to, through gentle suggestions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also suggest breastfeeding, by having the child undress its upper body to give the baby milk with its breasts.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may want to remind the child that it <u>can</u> have more babies if it wants to, so you can create a larger family with more than just <u>one</u> baby and child. This will make the child even more used to and thus increasingly comfortable towards this baby making in the bed, which usually and further turns them on sexually, increasing the chances of having the child suggest real sexual play, sooner or later.

                         Hence, why it's nice to have lots of small baby dolls available before setting up this game.

                         Many pedophiles have been playing this game with both little girls and little boys, and it goes <u>far</u> back in time and history.

                         But rubbing pants only, along with some cuddle and kissing, is usually not enough for many pedophiles. But the nice thing about this game is that it <u>can</u> be used to <u>easily</u> initiate real sexual play with genital contact and the ejaculation of semen.

                         This <u>can</u> be done during the first time you play this game, but it's usually best to do it after a few successful softcore editions; all depending on how well you know the child, and how much experience you got as a pedophile.

                         When you're at the point of explaining how to make babies, we will now do it the hardcore way instead:

                              <div class="text">
                                                                                     
                                   "Since there's no baby inside your tummy right now, we will have to make one."
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   "When adults make babies, they use their pee-pees to make them. Daddy rubs his pee-pee towards mommy's pee-pee, which tickles and feels <u>very</u> good for both mommy and daddy, and daddy finally puts baby seeds into mommy's pee-pee."
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   "<u>We</u> can do the same thing when <u>pretending</u> to make a baby; would you like to do that?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After <u>such</u> a direct suggestion, you will <u>quickly</u> notice if the child feels comfortable with it or not:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child seems very unsure and quiet after the suggestion, along with a little pout, it is most likely not ready for this, which should be respected.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the circumstances are ideal, most children should become <u>extremely</u> excited about this; maybe a little bit shy and giggling at first, but <u>still</u> very excited, deep down inside their sweet and young hearts.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Tell the child that you'll have to pull down your pants to make babies, and suggest that you do that simultaneously.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just be <u>patient</u> during this process, while staying positive and happy, even though if it becomes a time-consuming process. By rushing things at <u>this</u> very sensitive level, the child can quickly change its mind about doing this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child <u>does</u> changes its mind, or seems uncomfortable right after the suggestion itself, don't show any disapproval nor disappointment. Keep up your good mood, and just tell the child that you can make babies with your clothes on instead. You see, this is just the <u>beginning</u>; the child may <u>eventually</u> agree to do it without clothes on, either later during <u>this</u> session, or during another one in the future.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Being patient and tolerant, equals being smart!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If your pants finally go down, the child will most likely have its eyes staring at your genitals. Just let the child look at and study them for as long as it wants to, while you may study and admire the child's genitals yourself.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, ask the child if it's ready to make a baby on pretend, just like adults do in real life.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I recommend that you sit on the floor in front of each other during this activity, while suggesting and letting the child hold your penis and rubbing it towards its own genitals. This will seriously stimulate the child's sexual curiosity, excitement and arousal, while yet again giving it a sense of control.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may just ejaculate onto the child's genitals while the child is handling your penis; or you may take over and just tell the child that you'll need to take out the seeds now, and then cum all over the kid's crotch:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Look, here comes the seeds! And now I'm putting the seeds into your pee-pee so the baby can start growing inside you. But since you're a child, it won't be growing any baby inside you for real, we'll just pretend that it does."
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Wipe the cum off the child's crotch with a paper cloth, pull up your pants, and continue the game as already <a class="set3" href="#link2" target="_blank">explained</a>.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Hopefully, the child will enjoy this action and want to do it more, to make more babies. And you can make as many babies as you're able to cum onto the child's genitals.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may also undress all nude, lie on the floor, rub yourself towards each other, fuck the child between its thighs, and just make love together in any way you want to; as long as the child consents and you don't penetrate its genitals.

                         The Love Game is a very popular game among pedophiles that has been around and practiced for several decades.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It actually originates from a doctor in 1966, and surfaced on the Internet/Usenet for the first time in 1994, as someone made a word-by-word digital copy of the original writings.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It has become such popular because of its unique design that makes all pedophiles, newbies and experienced alike, able to seduce young children in a special way that is considered as very safe, with full control all the way through.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         What makes this design such unique is that it starts out as a legal and innocent game, but gradually develops into sex. This technique will give <u>any</u> young child a very gradual learning and adaption curve for sexual activities with adults; while the adult himself will be able to gradually test the child's tolerance for intimacy and sex while the game still is legal.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It is primarily based on exploring and massaging the child's body, which will make the child feel special, loved and good. The game will gradually become more erotically oriented, which eventually will involve kissing and licking of body parts.

                         Unlike previous versions, which you may already have read in various boards and guides, this version is based <u>directly</u> on the original writings from the 60s, but slightly modified to make it more suitable and safe to use in our present culture, while being updated with modern age child psychology.

                         This activity works on almost all children, but was originally intended for regular children within the ages of 4 and 10.

                                   Use a room that is familiar to the child, like its own bedroom or a play room, which it associates with comfort, play and fun.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   The child should have a comfortable bed or cushion to lie on, or any comfortable surface for that matter.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Increase the temperature of the room to above average, because being less clothed and nude can become freezing, thus uncomfortable and annoying for the child.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Make sure your hands aren't cold nor dry. Warm them up and use some moisture cream if necessary.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Keep an eye on the child's behavior during these sessions, and see if it ever gets uncomfortable, which makes it wise to tone things down a bit, or even stop completely.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   If you want to ejaculate into your pants during any of these sessions, without the child noticing it, or you just want to be prepared for that, just in case, strap a condom on in advance.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   When the game becomes sexual, have some clinex/paper cloths in your pocket to wipe cum.
                                                                                                         
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                                                           
                                   Some pedophiles are additionally using light effects, like a disco ball with stars that spins slowly around in the sealing; but mostly with toddlers and older mentally disabled/retarded children, to calm them down and make them lie still.
                                        
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         This activity consists of 6 steps, all of which can be executed at once during one single session, <u>or</u> split into several different sessions and days. Splitting is recommended so the children don't get too much to handle at once.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, the older children, like those being close to or older than 10, should be able to handle all these steps at once.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The steps and sessions goes as follow:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <ol>
                                        
                                   <li>The Feet</li>
                                   <li>The Arms</li>
                                   <li>The Face</li>
                                   <li>The Tummy</li>
                                   <li>The Butt</li>
                                   <li>The Genitals</li>
                                                                                     
                              </ol>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Please note that the introduction isn't considered as a regular step and session of the game, but rather a required <u>basis</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This means that the first step can be immediately executed after this introduction:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="the_introduction"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">The Introduction</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This activity starts with the introduction of a new game, which you will introduce to your special little friend.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is recommended that the game is introduced at the same location of where it will be practiced, ideally a location that the child associates with comfort, play and fun.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is also recommended to sit yourself comfortably down with your heads at the approximately same heights, or that the child sits a little it higher than you, when talking together about this game, whether being this introduction or any future step and session. This will make the child feel you as less authoritative, and itself as more powerful, which is important for the success of this game.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         An appropriate introduction would be something like this:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Do you know what? I know about a special game that adults and children can play together, which is very cool. Do you want to know more about this game?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such an opening will make most children very excited, as it exploits their natural strong curiosity and urge to play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I will therefore assume that you may continue:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "The game is called FeeGoo."
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         "Hey, wait a minute!", some of you may now say; those of you who have already read other versions of <b class="h">The Love Game</b>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, we won't call this game 'The Love Game' in real life, we will call it 'FeeGoo' instead, as in short for Feel Good.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's important to <u>not</u> use names for games that can easily be associated with erotic activities, because young children can easily mention the name of the game while other adults are nearby. 'FeeGoo' will sound more like a cartoon character rather than something adult related and potentially sinister.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, you'll feel much safer by doing this.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may call it whatever you like to, as long as it's not related to love and erotica. The name 'FeeGoo' may not have a nice ring to it in your language, and parents and schools who read this guide may even flag it and warn their children about it.

                         Let's tell the child some more about this special game:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">

                                   "The game FeeGoo has only <u>two</u> rules. Do you want to know what those rules are?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;

                         We're now feeding the child with information as incrementally as possible, to make sure that it understands the game fully.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         We're also playing with the child's engagement and curiosity, making it feel very involved and curious towards the game.

                         So, let's teach the child about the first rule:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "The first rule of FeeGoo is that the children can stop the game whenever they want to. You can just raise your hand and say <u>stop</u>, if you want the game to stop. You can also continue the game again by lowering your hand and saying <u>start</u>. You'll be just like a king or queen; you can stop and start the game <u>whenever</u> you want to, and as <u>much</u> as you want to."
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will give the child the immediate feeling of having full control and being the ruler of the game, making it feel both secure and excited towards it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's also <u>very</u> important to actually <u>have</u> such a rule, so it will be easier for the child to set and practice personal limits, especially when the game finally becomes erotic and sexual.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may of course show the child with your own hand how to stop and start the game, when explaining that first rule.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And then comes the second and last rule of the game:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "The second rule of FeeGoo is that it has to be a <u>secret</u>. That means we can't tell about it to <u>anyone</u>. This is because this is a <u>special</u> game; when we play it, we can do adult things that children aren't allowed to do, things that are <u>very</u> cool."
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Here, we are first of all establishing the secrecy, which will be very important for this whole activity.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         You may want to go deeper into secrecy practice by (re)visiting the <a class="set3" href="secrecy.html" target="_blank">Secrecy chapter</a> within the Security guide.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Second, we are exploiting the little rebellion and devil that exists within most children, while further fueling its curiosity.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, by making this rule into a 'child versus adult' thing, and <u>us</u> against <u>them</u>, you will more or less detach yourself from the general adult role, and thus make the child more easily see you as another 'child' instead of a typical adult. And <u>you</u> will suddenly become one of <u>them</u>, one of the children and their exclusive and otherwise inaccessible league.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This second rule is also an important test:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child suddenly becomes unsure or uncomfortable after having learned it, the child may have interpreted this game as something sinister. This could mean that this is <u>not</u> the right child for you to safely seduce and have sex with.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child still seems very excited towards this game, and motivated to play it, this will most likely be the right child for you to safely seduce and have sex with.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is great to know <u>before</u> the game starts and <u>before</u> the child learns what it's really about, which makes it very easy and safe for everyone to choose the <u>right</u> children.

                                   "Do you want to play this game <u>now</u>, and see how its like?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child agrees to play the game, you are free to start it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But before you start, ask the child if it remembers the rules, and ask if it can repeat them. You will then get a much better idea about how well the child has understood them.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Please note that it is important that the child doesn't learn anything about how the game is set up and works in advance. Each step and session has to be a surprise that you will explain to the child when it begins.

                         Most children are generally sensitive to physical closeness with other humans, especially with adults whom they don't yet know or trust fully. This sensitivity is at its highest around their heads, because everything feels so much closer there.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This game is designed in a way so it will <u>gradually</u> build trust between the two of you <u>and</u> make the child used to general intimacy with an adult. It is also designed to always make the child feel safe and comfortable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, regardless of how sensitive <u>your</u> child is, we will start this game by playing with the child's feet, being a totally harmless body part at the opposite end of its most sensitive area.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Make sure that you both sit comfortably down when you're about to explain the very basics about the game, and finally ask for permission to play with the child's feet:

                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "This game is all about playing with our <u>bodies</u>, because it is fun and it makes us feel good. So today, I would really like to play with your feet. Is that okay with you?"
                         
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         This is a very simple and honest explanation and suggestion. And by asking the child for permission before you start, the child will immediately feel safe and as being in control.

                         The younger children of this group will less likely understand your true and final intentions with this game, thus more likely agree to play it regardless of being truly ready for sex or not. You will anyway learn pretty soon if they <u>are</u> ready or not, without braking any laws, due to this game's unique design.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The older children of this group however, might just realize what's <u>really</u> going on here and where this <u>will</u> be heading, simply from this initial explanation and suggestion alone.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, since we're just suggesting playing with their <u>feet</u>, they shouldn't freak out like right away. But those who feel uncomfortable with the idea of playing with <u>other</u> and more <u>intimate</u> body parts in the future, will most likely become less enthusiastic or simply not agree to play the game at all.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         On another hand, many of the older children love the idea of body exploration and sexual play; so if an older child of this group seems very eager and enthusiastic towards this explanation and suggestion, it might just mean that you've just found yourself a child whom are truly ready for sex.

                         And this is actually a part of this game's very unique design, making you able to test the waters before things get too critical or illegal; a design that will continue throughout this whole game.

                         If the child consents to play the game: regardless of its age, let's remind it about its first rule:

                         This repetition will make the child feel even <u>more</u> secure.

                         Please note that we'll still be asking for permission for each thing we do during each session, even though the child has already agreed to play the game in the first place. It's important to <u>continuously</u> remind the child that it has total control and being the one in charge.

                         Undress the child's feet gently and in a loving way, while caressing its foot some in the process. This will create a quite loving and erotic setting, which several children will respond to with additional excitement and possibly arousal.

                                   A few children will already <u>now</u> raise their hand and say 'stop', but usually just to tease you <u>or</u> test if it really works.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   But this can happen at <u>anytime</u> in the future, <u>also</u> if the child should feel uncomfortable with whatever you're doing.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Regardless of which, if this happens, just stop whatever you're doing and look at the child with a smile. Let the child feel that it can stop the game <u>without</u> you getting disappointed or sad. Then tell the child that the game has now stopped, and see what the child does from there.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   If the child keeps looking at you and seems very unsure or uncomfortable, you may <u>suggest</u> stopping the game for now.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   If it has stopped the game, but still seems eager and excited, like smiling or biting on its lips or fingers, simply wait and see what happens, as they usually start the game again after a little break. But then be <u>very</u> careful when it starts again.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Most children who decide that they don't want to play this game anymore, will simply start taking their clothes back on without saying anything. You may then tell them that it is okay to stop the whole game for now, if they want to.

                         When the cute little feet are undressed, start by feeling them as sensually as possible, but don't yet feel them underneath.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All children have different feet sensitivities, so it will become hard feeling and massaging the feet of some children without them retracting their feet and laughing due to tickle. Just be patient if this happens and let them enjoy the fun, and never use any force to hold their feet still.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Feel their feet for a couple of minutes, while admiring them in an obvious way and giving them a few compliments.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Gently pinch and move their toes a little bit.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, try feeling their feet underneath, and just massage their whole feet in a loving, caring and sensual way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you feel that you have felt the feet enough, ask the child if you're allowed to <u>gently</u> hug and kiss them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is an important part of the child's learning and adaption curve for sexual play with adults, as this is the very first <u>real</u> erotic component of this game.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This part is also important because it will quickly show you how comfortable the child is towards erotic play in general, especially an older child who understands more:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you sense any insecurity after this suggestion, or if rejected, you may have a big obstacle in front of you. But don't loose all hope just yet; just shut the game down for now and try repeating this first session and step another day in the future, while having your fingers crossed during the second attempt.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child is all smiling and all happy about it, and consents, start out by gently and carefully kissing it around with dry lips.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then you may gradually start using your tongue some, and suck a little bit on the child's toes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child still seems comfortable with what you're doing, you may begin eating its feet up for real. That means <u>really</u> using your mouth and tongue to make them all clean.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're feeling a little bit bold, and want to push things a little bit further and increase the heat, you may <u>optionally</u> pull up the lower parts of the child's pants, and then feel it's lower legs some, in the same sensual way, up and down. Ask the child if it likes that, when doing it. But <u>never</u> exceed its knees.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And this should be all for now.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The length of the session can be all up to you, but it really doesn't have to be all that long. It can be as short as 5-10 minutes if you want to, and still be a very effective session.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         When the game is about to be shut down:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         <div class="quote_adult">

                         If the child should ask what part you'll be playing with the next time you play, it's important that you tell that it is a secret. This will really stimulate a child's already strong curiosity, and make it look much forward to the next session.

Some of these children may even be pure and simple horny.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Several pedophiles whom I've been in touch with, have gotten surprised during this game; as some of their children have actually suggested genital play, all by themselves and right out of the blue, regardless of their age.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   It is therefore very important that you prepare yourself for this possibility, as it is less rare than most would think. Children are so sexually curious and active that if they really like and trust you, this can happen at <u>anytime</u> during this game.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   <u>If</u> this happens, you will have 3 choices: tell them that you're not yet ready for such play yet, go through all of these steps in just one session, or jump straight to the last step.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   If you tell them that you're not yet ready, you should also tell them that you will get to that part soon, but you will play with other body parts first. And then decide for yourself what pace you want to use for this game.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Strange as it might sound, sometimes it is the pedophiles who need to raise their hand and say <u>stop</u>, because some children can be some truly horny beasts.

                         Whether being a brand new session another day, or an immediate continuation, this is the second physical contact that will lead to another body part, and <u>one</u> step closer to a lovely sexual relationship with a little sweetie of yours.
                         
                         <br />

                         As usual, we will start the game with a nice talk:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "You know what? I just <u>loved</u> playing with your feet! They where <u>so</u> cute, while both smelling and tasting so sweet! But <u>now</u>, I would like to play with something <u>else</u> on your beautiful body, which I haven't yet played with. And this time, I was thinking about your hands and arms. Am I allowed to do that?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, the child will now notice that the game is <u>still</u> very safe and harmless to play, which will further build trust between the two of you, which again will allow you to gradually increase the child's tolerance for intimate play with an adult.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The arms are however a lot closer to its main sensitive area, which is its head, but still not <u>there</u>. Most children should therefore allow you to start and continue this unusual game; especially if they enjoyed it when you played with their feet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="link3"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child has a regular sweater on, you may ask it to take it off, so you can better play with its arms. This is anyway a nice test to see how comfortable the child is towards <u>undressing</u> while playing this game and being in front of you.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child agrees to do this, without hesitating any, it will clearly mean that it isn't all that body shy, which would be a great thing for later. Most children <u>do</u> consent to taking off their sweaters at this stage, as this is a very light thing to do initially, while most have a t-shirt on underneath anyway.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, if it doesn't consent, it is usually considered as a bad sign. It may help repeating the first two steps of this game a few more times, while not undressing its upper body, to further build trust and comfort between the two of you; as the child may <u>eventually</u> agree to undress itself.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If it <u>never</u> agrees to undress its sweater, finding yourself another candidate is usually the best and safest thing to do.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you don't want to ask the child to undress its upper body, or the child doesn't want to, you may instead suggest pulling up its sleeves so you can access the skin of, at least, its lower arms. Or, just play with the arms with the sweater on.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                                 
                         The most practical thing to do in this step, is to choose <u>one</u> of the child's arms, and stick to that arm. In this way, you can sit on one side of the child while performing the whole step, while the child is lying comfortably down and enjoying it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may of course play with both of the child's arms if you prefer to, and have the child sit up instead of lying down; whatever works best for the both of you.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With permission from the child, start with the hand: caress it, tickle it, compliment it, love it, and just play with the whole hand and all of its fingers.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                        
                         Then move to the lower arm: caress it, up and down, slowly and gently, all around, as if it was made of velvet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may optionally suggest the child to just close its eyes and enjoy being felt, if it wants to.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After a while, do the same with the upper arm. And move your hands up to the top of the shoulder, but <u>not</u> any further.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These actions will be way more intimate and erotic than the latter step and feet play. The child should now become either consciously or subconsciously aware of that, depending on its IQ and age, which may lead to sexual excitement, and even arousal, within that tiny little body.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, try to notice if the child increases its breathing during this session, which can mean that it is becoming aroused, which again can mean that this child is a potential <u>winner</u>!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just continue feeling the arm all over, as sensually as you're able to, while optionally telling the child how special and beautiful the arm is, with a whispering voice. This can further trigger sexual arousal, while making the child feel loved.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then comes the critical question, which is asking the child if it's okay for you to hug and kiss its arm.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The child <u>should</u> be prepared for that question, because of the latter step and session, and probably expect it to happen, which <u>is</u> a good thing. <u>But</u>, the arms <u>are</u> a little more sensitive and critical than the feet, which <u>may</u> make the child become a little bit skeptical towards it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're ever unsure about the child's appreciation for this, you may want to reserve this question for a future session, which means that this step has to be repeated.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With permission, start by hugging its hands; just place them onto your face while looking deeply into the child's eyes. Then smell on them, and finally kiss them some with dry lips.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's usually pretty hot for a genuine pedophile to have small children hands over his face, which usually triggers a lightening within us of love for children and sexual arousal.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Do the same with the underarm; place it onto your face, smell on it, and finally kiss it at various places with dry lips.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Children arms smell <u>so</u> nice, don't they?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you're about to move to the upper arm, first place the child's arm carefully down, and then start smelling it, up and down. You may finally start kissing it in the same way as you kissed the underarm. Just keep moving your head up and down along the whole arm, and just show the child how much you love its beautiful and innocent little body.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The kisses may increasingly become wetter, and you may <u>carefully</u> use your tongue at the end of the session, and lick the arm a little bit while kissing it.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you want to extend the game, suggest doing the same procedure on the other arm as well, and just repeat this step on that arm.

                         When the time has come to quite the game for now, let's perform a regular and nice shutdown:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                                   "Once again, the game is over for now. But now I've been able to play with <u>another</u> part of your special and beautiful body, which I enjoyed very much doing. And I hope that you enjoyed it as much as I did. If you want to, we can play it again another day. And then, maybe I can find <u>another</u> part of your beautiful body to play with?"
                         
                              </div>

                         If this is an ideal child, she or he will become pretty excited about this game at this point, and really look forward to the next session and body part.

                         Or instead, move to the next step and session right away, if you think that <u>this</u> is safe and secure to do.

                         Now it becomes way more challenging than anytime before, because <u>now</u> we will move to the child's <u>face</u>. Yes, you read correctly, the face!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The reason for focusing on the face now, is to further test the child's acceptance towards general intimacy with adults, and intimacy with <u>you</u> especially. This will be a <u>very</u> important test to see how much the child <u>really</u> likes and accepts you.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Not only will it become a test, but it will also become very hot, and kind of similar to the former kissing game activity.
                         
                         <br />

                         So, let's go about this sensitive body part <u>carefully</u>:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "I am <u>so</u> happy that we started to play this special game together, because I <u>so</u> love playing with your body; it is <u>so</u> beautiful and it smells and tastes <u>so</u> nice."
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   "I've already played with your beautiful feet and your beautiful arms; so <u>now</u> I would <u>really</u> like to play with something that's even <u>more</u> beautiful than your feet and arms, and that is your hair and face. Therefore I ask once again, am I allowed to play with your hair and face today, if I <u>promise</u> to be <u>very</u> careful?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All you can do now is hold your breath and wait for the child to react and reply. And <u>hopefully</u>, it will grant you permission and access to it's most sensitive and critical body part, it's beautiful face where all it's primary senses are located, thus why it is so sensitive and hard to get to without rejections.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Look at it as an exclusive golf club; with access to that club, you'll be playing golf with kings and presidents. And when you first get to know kings and presidents, you will more likely be granted access to even more exclusive clubs later.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In other words, when granted full access to a child's face, you will more likely be granted full access to its more intimate and exclusive body parts later, like its butt and genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now, it is <u>extremely</u> important to do things <u>very</u> incrementally. So, we will start this step by just fiddling with the child's hair. You may also pet its head and stream your fingers through the hair, while telling the child that its hair feels so nice to touch.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then move to the child's ears, and just feel them gently.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Move from the ears and slowly towards its cheeks. Use the upper side of your fingers to gently stroke and feel the child's cheeks. And feel the cheeks in this way for a little while, before you turn your hands around and start doing the same with the underside of your fingers.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may do some silly stuff to make the child giggle, like tickling its neck and gently pinching its nose while making a horn sound. This is a great thing to do so this session doesn't become too serious and gloomy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now its time to move towards the most important part of the face, and that's the child's beautiful, wet and red lips!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Gently move one for your fingers from one side of the mouth and to the other, straight over the child's lips. And repeat this a few times, left to right, right to left, and so forth.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child opens its mouth some, circle your finger around its lips, just as gently.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Let's compliment them while being there:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "I didn't know that something could ever feel as soft and nice as your lips do. They're truly nice to touch and beautiful to watch. Your lips are truly special."
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now, even the youngest and least intelligent child of this group will sense that this behavior is quite unusual, which either can become exciting and arousing for the child, or outright creepy; all depending on your current relationship with the child and the trust between the two of you.
                         
                         <br />

                         Thus, the next moves should probably only be executed if the child seems to appreciate what you've done so far, and still seems comfortable with all of it.
                         
                         <br />

                         Put your index finger on the child's left or right cheek:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         With permission to do so, kiss its left or right cheek gently, slowly and lovingly. Kiss it three times in a row, with a second or so between each kiss.

                         Then point on the other cheek, and ask the same question, followed by the same action.

                                   Notice how the child reacts to this: if it smiles or giggles, it should be safe to continue. If it seems to tighten up and become less comfortable, <u>this</u> would be the place to stop this step and session; and then retry it another day, optionally after having repeated the former two steps in advance.

                                   Of course, if you're totally new to this and concerned about going for the mouth, you may split the game here anyway.

                         <u>Finally</u>, put your finger on the child's mouth:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                                   "Am I allowed to kiss your face <u>there</u>?"
                         
                              </div>

                         <br />
                         
                         Don't become surprised nor disappointed if you get rejected, <u>or</u> if the child lifts its hand up and says <u>stop</u>. It may also cover its mouth quickly with one hand while smiling or giggling.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This actually happens a lot, since the child's mouth is a <u>very</u> intimate and private body part, which <u>should</u> be respected.
                         
                         <br />

                         This should therefore be handled in a special way:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                                   "You know what? That is <u>perfectly</u> okay. Because <u>this</u> game has one important rule, and that rule says that the children in this game can say <u>stop</u> whenever they want to. I've <u>already</u> kissed so many special parts of your body, so I am actually very happy right now. Maybe you'll allow me to kiss your lips another day."
                         
                              </div>

                         It's important to show a great deal of respect towards such a rejection, so the child won't end up feeling guilty or bad about having rejected you, which can easily happen and negatively affect the child's relationship to this game in general.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, the child may just be immediately and temporarily unsure about it, or a little bit shy, thus <u>eventually</u> grant you access after a few minutes of further caressing and fooling with its hair and face. Just be patient, and don't push the child in any way into doing it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Based on the feedback I've gotten from other pedophiles, <u>most</u> of them have been (eventually) allowed to kiss the children's lips during <u>this</u> session.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With permission to do so, kiss the child's lips <u>gently</u> three times in a row, just as you did on all the previous parts of the face that you've already kissed and covered.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And that kiss should be the grand finale of this step!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Just shut the game down as you did with the latter steps.

                         The final stop, before this activity becomes fully sexual and illegal by law, is the child's tummy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is a very important move, first of all because the child may now notice that you're getting closer to its genital area. Thus, once again you will get a better idea about what the child really thinks about this game <u>and</u> its development.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Another important element of this session is that tummy play will give you the opportunity to suggest a <u>full</u> undressing of the child's upper body, which will further test the child's tolerance towards undressing; while also confirming for the child that this game is <u>really</u> moving towards a sexual game.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, one step up on the child's learning and adaption curve for sexual play with adults, we will now gently go:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

And I <u>really</u> enjoyed playing with your hair and face, since they're so cute and beautiful.

                              </div>

                         You may tickle the child's tummy a little bit at the end of the sentence, to create a fun and light atmosphere around you.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Am I <u>allowed</u> to play with your tummy, my little friend?"
                         
                              </div>

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The tummy is a very harmless area of the body, actually more harmless than the face for the average child, making it <u>very</u> likely that the child will feel comfortable towards this session, thus fully agree to it; especially if things have gone well so far.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is also a place that easily tickles, which most children already know, making this suggestion quite exciting as well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is therefore very <u>unlikely</u> that the child will disagree to this; and if it does disagree or seems uncomfortable towards it, you should take that as a very bad sign.
                         
                         <br />

                         With permission to play with its tummy, we will first try having the child undress itself:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "This tummy play will become a lot more exciting and funny if you undress your whole upper body this time. But <u>only</u> if you want to do that, of course. So, is it okay with you to take off your sweater <u>and</u> your t-shirt this time?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child agreed to take off its sweater during the arm play in step 2, it will most likely accept undressing all of its upper body at this stage, which most children will agree to anyway.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child doesn't agree to do this, in one way or another, or <u>you</u> feel uncomfortable asking for this at this stage, this step can be fully completed and enjoyed by asking the child to pull up its sweater, along with whatever it may have underneath, just enough for the tummy to reveal itself.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child doesn't want to undress itself, and <u>neither</u> wants to pull up its sweater for you, I'd say that you may be dealing with the wrong child there.

                         Start the game by gently placing your whole hand over the child's tummy, ideally with your palm centered over its bellybutton.

                         Then move it slightly forwards and backwards, in a stroking way, so the child feels that it moves sideways over its tummy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After a little while of such stroking, start moving your hand in a circular way around its tummy, while staying clear of its private parts with an obvious and respectful distance. And from there, just caress its tummy all over, while carefully and incrementally trying to cover its chest and nipples as well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you've already played with the child's arms and face with success, you may now start to feel the child <u>all</u> over its upper body by using both of your hands. But do stay focused on its tummy and chest during this step and session.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child is easily tickled, and thus becomes hard to keep still and calmed while caressing its tummy, you may focus the caressing over the child's chest and nipples instead.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                                           
                         Just continue letting your hands glide over the child's tummy and chest for a while, and see how it reacts to it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If the child seems to enjoy what you're doing, especially if it seems to become aroused from it, whisper to the child:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Whisper will make the game more secretive and enticing!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With permission to do so, lay your head down on the tummy while looking up at the child's face. You may additionally continue feeling the child's arms and chest while doing this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then turn your head and lips towards the tummy and start kissing it. Begin at the bellybutton, and work your way up towards the nipples, which you may lick and suck on some. Then move down again and just kiss and lick the whole tummy in a sensual and erotic way; optionally while feeling the rest of the child's upper body with your hands.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're feeling brave and bold, another optional action would be to feel the child's upper body with one hand, while feeling its lower body with the other; as in feeling the whole child all over while you kiss and lick its tummy, chest and nipples. But <u>not</u> touching its private areas, of course.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can trigger some serious sexual arousal, but it can <u>also</u> have the opposite effect, as in freaking the child out.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you want to stay safe, I recommend being very careful about touching and caressing the child while you're enjoying its tummy with your mouth. At least do it incrementally, while watching the child's reactions to what you're doing.

                                   Most children will <u>instinctively</u> react sexually to such play; because their bodies will feel sexually seduced, and thus start the arousal process, which can have various consequences:
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Some kids will just stare at you with two big and serious eyes, while gradually breathing faster and stiffening up to lumber.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This usually regards the younger children of this stage, and little girls especially, as they're experiencing true sexual arousal for the very first time in their lives.

                                   If they don't take any actions themselves from that point, just continue and complete this step as described; but you may want to tone things down a bit, or even stop completely, if they also seem to become uncomfortable or frighted.

                                   Others will begin touching <u>your</u> arms or upper body as well as you are touching <u>them</u>, usually while smiling at you.

                                   This usually means that they're in the process of exploring sex, but still being quite unsure about how to handle those feelings, making it <u>very</u> important for you to take things <u>very</u> gradually and carefully from there and towards sexual play.

                                   The oldest children of this group, while being very outgoing and brave, may simply begin opening the button and zipper of their pants; something that doesn't happen all that often, but does happen now and then with some pedophiles.

                                   Anything can happen, regardless of gender and age; they may thus suggest sexual play in many different ways at this point.

                         You may want to try what professional pedophiles refer to as indirect masturbation of children, which can become <u>very</u> effective if you do it correctly, especially on little girls.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, it <u>can</u> be a risky move, thus why it is <u>highly</u> optional.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Indirect masturbation of children can be done by laying your whole hand onto the child's tummy at its lowest point, as in having your pinky or thumb towards the edge of its pants, and then move the hand up and down in a decent pace while pushing it gently down on the genital side.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will stretch and release the child's skin all the way down to its genitals, thus stimulate them physically and possibly trigger sexual arousal; even trigger an orgasm if you do it correctly for a certain amount of time.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will also be staying in a gray zone legally wise, as you're actually not stimulating the child's genitals <u>directly</u>. Genital stimulation will only be a side effect of rubbing it's tummy, which is perfectly legal in most countries. Or else, they would have to ban and make tickle illegal as well.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The child however, may not enjoy it. It may tickle too much, or these movements may cause physical discomfort inside its tummy. So, try this consistently for only 5-10 seconds at first, and then stop and ask the child how it felt.

                         This could be a great idea regardless, as it will make the child even <u>more</u> used to sensual and erotic body play, <u>and</u> get further used to having <u>you</u> all over it and enjoying it.

                              If the child seems to enjoy this step, and have been enjoying all previous steps so far, it will be very safe to proceed to the next; which is the step that will make this game <b>fully sexual</b>.

                              If you sense that the child is <u>still</u> unsure and uncomfortable, or it has rejected undressing its upper body: unless more repetitions of the first 4 steps help, <u>this</u> might <u>not</u> be the right child to <u>safely</u> seduce sexually and continue having sex with into the future.

                              This is the point of no return, the event horizon, where you'll have to make that final decision if <u>this</u> is the child whom you feel <u>truly</u> comfortable seducing sexually.

                                   If you've been splitting each of these steps into different sessions at different days until now, you will not have to split them anymore. If you're granted access to a child's butt, you've already come so far that it should be safe to proceed directly to its genitals during the same session.

                                   Many children will also just show you their genitals, all by themselves and their own will, during this part.

Do whatever makes you most comfortable as a sexually practicing pedophile.

                         The child may now become surprised, if it isn't prepared for this, which can result in various different reactions.
                         
                         <br />

                         Or, it expects it to happen, and hopefully wants it to happen, which will be a very good sign and <u>your</u> ticket to Heaven.

                         You should <u>only</u> proceeded from here if the child seems <u>very</u> positive to this idea, and have been positive to this activity as a whole until <u>this</u> point. Such a child will be the least likely one to tell about it, because it will most likely feel comfortable towards <u>you</u> and your special game, while enjoying playing it.

                         You should also try making sure that the child agrees to proceed to butt play because it really <u>wants</u> to; and not because it feels like it <u>has</u> to, whether it is afraid of saying no, afraid of disappointing you, or afraid of loosing your friendship; all of which can be hard to detect sometimes.

                         If the child proceeds to sexual play without <u>really</u> wanting to, it will more likely tell about it, sooner or later.

                         The game starts by <u>gently</u> asking the child to lower its pants:

                                   "For me to be able to see your butt, you will have to open and pull down your pants. But you don't have to pull them all the way down if you don't want to; you may only pull down your backside, since I'm only looking at your <u>butt</u>. Actually, you may pull them down in any way you like."

                         <br />
                         
                         We will only emphasize on <u>looking</u> at this point, as this can be a big and somehow scary step to make for certain children.

                         And, we let the <u>child</u> decide <u>how</u> to pull down its pants. Because, some children will only accept pulling their pants down just a little bit to show their butt, at least during the first session(s) of such play. Others will pull their pants all the way down, while being very little shy and afraid about doing so.

                         It is <u>very</u> important to give the kid control over this crucial step, as that will <u>only</u> be beneficial for you, as a practicing pedophile, in the sweet and sugary end.

                         <br />
                         
                         This time, the child will most likely be standing instead of lying down while showing you its butt; because it has to pull down its pants. You may therefore sit yourself down on the floor right behind the child while it pulls down its pants, so you get close to that cute little bummie.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When the bummie is revealed in front of you, just look at it while admiring and complimenting it, like telling the child how soft and beautiful it looks. It may giggle when you say that, but that's a very positive sign that should only be embraced.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After a minute or two of looking at it, you may carefully ask the child if you're allowed to gently touch it some.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This suggestion is usually fine with most kids, especially since the child has more or less <u>already</u> agreed to it before you started. And having already touched your little friend at several other parts of its body in the <u>right</u> ways, it <u>also</u> knows how careful and respectful you are towards its body in general.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, if the child seems a little bit unsure or concerned about this suggestion, immediately tell the child that it is all fine to just watch it this time. And then make another attempt, either after some more watching or the next time you play.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A child's buttocks are <u>extremely</u> nice to touch if you haven't done that before; they are super soft and bouncy. So, with permission to touch the bum, just lay your hand carefully onto the buttocks, and just feel them and squeeze them gently.
                         
                         <br />

                         After some gentle touching and squeezing of the buttocks, you may carefully slide your finger down and into the butt crack, and gently rub the child's anus up and down; ideally in a very incremental way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may eventually push the anus a little bit inwards, without any penetration of course, as this may feel nice and arouse the child sexually. Just push the anus inwards and outwards an inch or so, and see how the child reacts to it.

                                   Even though if you can clearly see the child's genitals from behind, and being very tempted to touch it, especially if this is a wet and dripping kiddie vagina, keep your hands away from it during this session. You haven't yet asked for permission to touch it, and you don't want to break this special confidence that you've built up between the two of you up to this point.

                         Finally, ask the child for permission to hug and kiss its butt.

                         The final step of The Love Game <small>(v2)</small> is to explore the genitals of the children; and eventually let the children explore the genitals of the adults.

                         This step and session <u>should</u> go smoothly <u>if</u> the latter went smoothly as well. For most children, the butt and the genitals are basically the same, especially for the younger ones.

                         I've been asked several times during the years, how much you should try convincing children to do things they don't want to. And my answer is now as it has always been: if you <u>want</u> to stay safe, <u>never</u> try convincing them to participate in sexual activities if they don't want to <u>nor</u> if they want to stop them. Convincing or forcing children to do such will more likely get you caught in one way or another, sooner or later.

                         <u>If</u> the child should be skeptical towards genital play at this point, you may suggest to <u>only</u> look at it, as this will be a nice and incremental start. And from there, ask the child if you're allowed to just careful put your finger on it; and just see if you can get full access to it through such incremental sub-steps.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Or, repeat the latter step more times, and then make another attempt to see its genitals during one of those sessions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child agrees to this genital play: just as with butt play, tell that she or he can decide how the pants go down or off, and how the genitals are shown.

                         However, you may want to suggest that the child lies down on its back in a bed or chair while you sit in front of it and its genitals. This isn't just the hottest position you can be in when exploring kiddie genitals, but also the most practical and comfortable for the both of you.

                         Eventually, the time will come for the child to explore <u>your</u> genitals as well. This can be done either during <u>this</u> step and session, in one go, or during another one in the future.

                         If the child just got a strong orgasm during the play and masturbation of <u>its</u> genitals, it might be wise to stop the game for now and continue with the exploration of <u>your</u> genitals another day and session, so the little sweetie doesn't get too much sex to handle at once. Though, the older children, like the 7-10 year olds, should be able to handle it much better.

                         As usual, go carefully about this:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child seems skeptical, emphasize that it doesn't <u>have</u> to touch it, if it doesn't want to, just look at it from a distance.
                         
                         <br />

                         If it doesn't want to see it at all, just stop the game for now, and just ask it again another time when you play this game.
                         
                         <br />

                         Though, it would be <u>very</u> strange if the child wouldn't want to see your genitals at this point, especially after having already granted you access to its <u>own</u>.

                         This is a quite special activity, being very similar to the activity in the Babies&#160;and&#160;Toddlers chapter that is called The&#160;Hungry&#160;Slut, as the child will now perform oral sex on you without actually being aware of it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <u>This</u> game however, with a new name, has been modified to fit average children instead of babies and toddlers.

                         The Tasting Game is all about letting the children taste different stuff while being blindfolded and tied up. You will put a lot of different stuff into their mouths, which they can taste, and they can then try guessing what it was. And of course, you'll be putting a lot of nice and <u>sweet</u> stuff into their mouths, so they will enjoy the game and <u>want</u> to play it.

                         As you may already have figured out, one of those things that you'll be putting into their mouths, will of course be your very own penis. Your penis will glide into their wet, delicious and innocent red mouths, so they can lick it, taste it, and <u>suck</u> it.
                         
                         <br />

                         This game can also be played with more than one child, as that can become very funny and make the children feel even more comfortable and secure towards it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         A lot of trust will be required for this game; because tying the children up and blindfolding them <u>will</u> be a part of the game, which they <u>must</u> agree and consent to in advance.
                         
                         <br />

                         It may therefore become hard to convince the more shy and skeptical kids to participate, while the wild and crazy ones will do it willingly and have lots of fun regardless.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you end up being able to convince a shy and skeptical child to participate, you may want to wait with using your penis until you've successfully played the game a few times with innocent props only; just to build some trust and confidence first.

                                   Make sure that you're all alone and private during these sessions, and won't be disturbed nor surprised during them.

                                   Make sure to have all clean genitals, as <a class="set3" href="swk_prep.html#hygiene_practice" target="_blank">described</a> in the latter preparation chapter. Unclean adult genitalia is usually considered as repulsive among regular children, which may cause an activity to fail miserably <u>and</u> be hard to repeat.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This activity should be planned and prepared in advance. However, if you're not able to plan it to a certain time and place, at least have everything ready until a window of opportunity suddenly opens one day, which you can exploit. 
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   A rope or handcuffs are obviously needed; <u>real</u> handcuffs that fits children are <u>ideal</u>. Toy handcuffs from toy stores should be avoided for the older children, as they will more easily be able to get out of them, or even break them.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   A blindfold is obviously needed as well. Sleeping blindfolds are <u>highly</u> recommended, as they are the most efficient and safe to use if you don't want the child to see what's really happening through cracks and openings. You may want to add some facial cotton pads over their closed eyes before putting the blindfold on, as that really blinds them <u>while</u> feeling comfortable.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   A large towel is highly recommended to put onto the child during this activity, as it can become pretty messy with lots of <u>different</u> substances being poured over it.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Then prepare different objects for the child to taste, and <u>only</u> objects that <u>either</u> tastes nice <u>or</u> don't taste anything at all.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Recommended objects are different types of fresh food, like slices and pieces of fruits and vegetables. Candy is also recommended, like bars that they can taste, lick and suck on. You should add tasteless objects as well, like a remote control, pacifier and a plastic figure, which should be all clean.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   The first <u>required</u> part of your tasting compendium is plain yogurt that doesn't have any flavors nor sugar added. It has to be warmed up to room temperature <u>right</u> before your start.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   The second <u>required</u> object, or group of objects of you like, is a set of sweet sauces and cremes; like vanilla and caramel sauces, and white cake creme. The more and the sweeter, the better. And these should ideally be cold.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   The third and last <u>required</u> object is a large sausage.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   It is <u>very</u> important that you don't make <u>any</u> compromises with the child regarding the basic rules of the game. The child <u>has</u> to be tied up, it <u>has</u> to be blindfolded, and it <u>has</u> to agree to playing it. If you can't fulfill <u>all</u> these 3 rules, the game should <u>not</u> be played because of security reasons.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Have your zipper already pulled down, as most children of this group will recognize that sound, and thus understand what's happening. Ideally, use sweatpants without a zipper.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   You may also want to turn a radio on in the same room as the game is being played within, with music that the child likes, to conceal your moaning and grunting when the child starts sucking you; especially if you're fortunate enough to ejaculate inside its mouth.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Keep an eye on the child's behavior during these activities, and see if it ever gets uncomfortable, which makes it wise to tone things down a bit, or even stop completely.

                         We will start this activity by suggesting the game to the child in a way so it sounds exciting, fun and harmless:
                         
                         <br />

                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "You know what? I know about a very cool game, which is very fun to play. Do you want to know more about it?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>

                         By giving the child a choice like this, you will make it feel like being in control at <u>once</u>, and thus create a great basis for the real suggestion that comes next:
                         
                         <br />

                                   "This game is called: the tasting game. And it is a very fun game, because it is all about tasting different stuff that you must guess what is. And to prevent cheating, your arms have to be tied and your eyes have to be blindfolded."
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   <br />

                                   "So, do you dare to play it, or does it sound too scary?"

                         The use of the word <u>dare</u>, and indirectly suggesting that the child may be too scared to play it, will actually provoke most kids <u>into</u> playing it, so they can prove that they're not afraid nor being cowards; just an old trick to improve your odds.

                         <br />
                         
                         If there are more than just one kid there, you can make this game into a <u>competition</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child agrees to play it, make it first of all sit down on a comfortable chair with its head at the approximately same height as your penis when you stand in front of it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child sits too high, just use a solid box or some large books to stand on when that time comes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Tie or handcuff the child with its arms <u>behind</u> its back; but <u>remember</u> to tie the rope or handcuffs to the back of the chair as well, so the child can't raise up or move around.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Put or tie a towel on the front of the child, ideally so it covers its whole front side. Tell the child that some sweetness can drip down during the play, which will sound pretty harmless.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then blindfold the child and make sure that it can't see <u>anything</u> through cracks and openings. Decent sleeping blindfolds, optionally with facial cotton pads over its eyelids, will make sure this doesn't happen.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Ask the child if it feels comfortable and if it <u>still</u> wants to play the game. Remind the child that it can stop the game whenever it wants to. This will increase its comfort level.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Tell the child that you will now get the things for the tasting game, and put those things on a table nearby.
                         
                         <br />

                         Tell the child that there are certain things that it can't bite on or eat, and there are other things that it can eat if it wants to; and that <u>you</u> will tell it what it can eat and not during the game.

                                   Always perform the next actions from either the left or right side of the child, not from its front. And always stay very close to the child while performing all of them, at the same location.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   For example: when the child is about to taste the first object, stand on the child's right side and ask it to lean towards you. Then let it taste the object while you stand in the <u>exact</u> same position as if it was tasting your cock. When you finally get to the point of letting the child taste your cock, it won't sense any difference in terms of your position and presence.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   This practice will make it both <u>easier</u> and <u>safer</u> when the child is finally about to taste your cock.

                         <br />
                         
                         It is <u>very</u> important that the child gets a very good and safe first impression of the game, so start with something very nice and easily guessable; it can be a slice of an orange.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Ask the child to lean towards you, until it can't get any further, and gently let it lick on and taste the orange slice.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This should be easily guessable, so applaud the child for having guessed correctly. But remind it that it <u>will</u> become more difficult to guess things as the game proceeds.
                         
                         <br />

                         Take out your penis and pull your foreskin backwards, and just let it hang out in fresh air while you continue letting the child taste other stuff. It's important that it smells and tastes as fresh and clean as possible when that time comes.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Let the child taste and guess various stuff while your penis is airing itself and growing larger. Give it some pieces of candy now and then to eat, to keep its motivation up, like delicious confetti and jelly beans.
                                                  
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It would be ideal if your cock is either partially or completely stiff at this point, so try jerking it some if you are too tense to get an erection all by itself.
                         
                         <br />

                         Drip a few drops of caramel or vanilla sauce onto the head of your penis, and ask the child to move towards you until it gets restrained. In this way, you will be able to control the child's body position so the game doesn't get revealed by accident.
                         
                         <br />

                         Tell it not to bite or thew now, just lick and taste, while trying to guess what the next tastes are. And then let it <u>carefully</u> lick and taste the <u>tip</u> of your penis.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may gradually move closer to the child's mouth, so the penis goes further inside its mouth, but not too far though.

                         Then ask the child if it can guess the flavor of what it tasted.

                                   The child will probably become a little bit confused now, as it will most likely not understand what that huge and warm thing it just had in its mouth really was, but in the same time being able to guess the sweet flavor that was added to it.

                                   All children react differently to this. Some just keep on guessing the sweet substances you add, without thinking too much about that huge and warm thing. Other children become very curious about it, especially the older ones.

                                   You may tell those curious children whom should ask, that you use a special prop so they can easily taste certain flavors.

                         Continue dripping or adding different sweet stuff onto your penis head, and let the child lick and suck you, while both guessing and enjoying all that sweet stuff.

                         And, since you're feeding the kid with small portions at a time, you can potentially do this for a pretty long time. And the child will most likely want to keep on doing it, since it tastes so sweet and nice. You know, kids can't get enough of sweets!
                                             
                         <br />

                         If you get to the point of where you feel like ejaculating, whether it happens all by itself or you just want to jerk that sexual tension out of yourself, the safest thing to do is obviously to ejaculate onto the tower in front of the child, or onto something else, and not into the child's mouth.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, the child <u>will</u> be tied up and it <u>will</u> be blindfolded, so it shouldn't understand what happens if you decide to ejaculate into its mouth. But it's hard to know for <u>sure</u> how a child will react to this, and how much it will understand.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It may also be hard for you to fully control your breathing and grunting while this happens, making this hard to conceal.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The younger children, from 7 years and younger, will be much safer to ejaculate into, contrary to the older children. It will also be safer to ejaculate into their mouths from a distance, like having the cock a couple of inches from their faces, and just come all over their sweet and red mouths.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You must also consider the danger of leaving any sperm on the child's clothes, hair or skin, as this can prove through DNA forensics that you've molested and raped the child orally.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Well, the final decision will be yours and yours only, and should be thoroughly thought through in advance.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When the game is over, make first sure that your penis is put back into your pants. Then wipe the child's face, take off the towel and blindfold, and finally uncuff it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         You may have all the tasting objects lying on the table, so the child can see them afterwards. But the coolest trick of them all comes here: as soon as the child is untied, start eating that large sausage that is a <u>required</u> part of this activity. If the child should ask what you used to drip sauce and creme on, and what it sucked on, you can tell it that it is this delicious sausage that you're now eating. And before the child can even get a close look at it, you have already eaten it all up.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, if it should ask what that (yucky and) warm creme at the end was, if you ejaculated into or over its mouth, you can just show the child the plain yogurt with room temperature.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                                 
                         If it doesn't become curious about any of the critical ingredients of the game, simply don't mention anything; just enjoy that sausage <u>and</u> relief from having had a sexual intercourse with a sweet and young child (for the first time).

                                   Children boys will be way more able to recognize a penis when getting one into their mouths, as they already <u>have</u> one themselves that they've most likely been exploring and playing with for several years, especially boys older than 7. They may even have sucked their friends off during sexual play, which will almost certainly make them recognize one.

                                   Children girls will, on another hand, very little likely recognize a cock in their mouths, even though if they're older than 7. They don't <u>have</u> a penis, and have less likely been able to yet study one thoroughly enough to recognize one through tasting only.

                                   It will therefore and generally be much safer to practice this on children from the age of 7 and <u>younger</u>; the safest of them all being the youngest <u>girls</u>.

                                   If a child is either old or smart enough to immediately recognize that you're putting a penis inside its mouth, it may freak out at various levels. The best thing to do if this happens, is to quickly hide your penis and stop the game completely. This <u>could</u> cause them to tell about it to other adults later, but most of them won't do that because of the taboo and embarrassment that will be involved; <u>which</u> you may have to remind them about if they threaten to tell about it.

                                   You will of course deny that you've ever put a penis into their mouths, and try doing your very best calming them down.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   If you should ever get confronted by another adult whom the child has told about your activities to, stay calm and just tell what you did, <u>except</u> for the part of using your penis of course. Also mention that this is initially a very cool game that you've played a lot when you where young yourself, and that the child simply didn't like it, and you won't be playing it again.

                                   If you left no sperm onto the child's clothing or body during this activity, you should be pretty much safe legally wise.
