                         The time has come to perform sexual activities with <u>children</u>; whether being the very first and life changing experience for a newcomer pedophile, an opportunity for the experienced pedophile to enjoy yet another child while refining his or her practices, or a non-pedophile who's curious about how <u>real</u> pink or blue cotton-candy tastes like.

                         The way you treat your little sweeties during sexual activities, will decide the success and final outcome for the both of you:

                         <span class="glow_lightgreen">Good treatment</span> will first of all give you generally safe and secure sexual relationships with most children, as in motivating them to keep your secrets and not reveal anything through any unorthodox behavior afterwards.

                         The children will additionally become very motivated to <u>continue</u> having such relationships with you, because they will enjoy what you do together; which will further secure your secrets while increasing the <u>amount</u> of sexual activities.

                         They will also be much easier to penetrate and much more likely enjoy that, even if it becomes unpleasant or painful.

                         The most important thing about good treatment of children during sexual activities, is that these children will more likely grow up with a <u>positive</u> feeling towards sexual relationships between adults and children; which means that a new generation of sexually <u>liberated</u> human beings will arise and help us legalize pedophilia in the future, as the future children are the only ones who can help us accomplish that.

                         Good treatment of children will also help your conscience, and make you feel good about yourself after your orgasms.

                         <span class="glow_red">Bad treatment</span> will generally reduce your personal security down to a dangerously low level, by ripping away the children's motivation to keep your illegal activities a secret.

                         Even if you <u>threaten</u> them to keep secrets, they will most likely reveal them anyway, sooner or later, through an unorthodox behavior; which may alert an observant adult, like a vigilant parent or an educed teacher.

                         These children will try doing <u>anything</u> to grab the attention of other adults, as they really want you to stop hurting them.

                         When they finally grow up to become stronger and more independent beings, they will most likely report you to the law enforcement regardless.

                         These children will also try avoiding you as much as possible, making it much harder to have sex with them, while obviously decreasing the amount of sexual activities to a minimum.

                         Penetrating these children will also become very difficult, causing most to cry and scream, and squirm all around.

                         And, they will finally end up with an <u>awful</u> view on pedophilia, which will raise a new generation of angry and hateful anti-pedophiles, who will look at <u>all</u> sexual relationships between adults and children as something extremely dirty, shameful and harmful; and continue suppressing and hurting <u>all</u> pedophiles as long as they live.

                         <br />
                         
                         Treating children badly doesn't benefit anyone in the end.

                         <span class="glow_lightgreen">Good treatment</span> is therefore recommended when practicing sexual activities with children, to keep yourself as safe as possible, keep the children as happy as possible, and experience the longest, deepest, wettest and warmest intercourses possible with these delicious little creatures; while raising a new generation of humans whom will more likely accept all this and continue practicing it as adults.

                         The most successful sexual relationships between adults and children, are the relationships of which the <u>children</u> are the ones who are in control and have the final words during sex.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you look at sexual child love practice as a vessel, like a ship, all children should ideally decide if they want to enter this vessel in the first place. And those who dare to enter it, should be able to decide its direction and throttle. Of course, while the adult carefully steers away from any obstacles and dangerous waters. And, if a certain child should be unsure about controlling this vessel all together, you can carefully control it instead, while always asking the child for permission when controlling the vessel's direction and throttle.

                         In other words, a child should ideally <u>agree</u> to any sexual activity between the two of you before you actually engage it. From there, it should ideally <u>decide</u> what to do and how far to go, while <u>controlling</u> the pace. And if a child agrees to play, but is totally unsure about what to do, you can carefully control the whole activity yourself while always asking for permission to do things and monitoring the child's behavior.

                         All sexual play, especially with adults, is a very unknown and scary territory for most children. It's like exploring a large and dark caste at night; it can become terrifying, but in the same time so exciting and thrilling that they vibrate all over.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If <u>they</u> have full control over the situation, <u>they</u> can decide the strength, length and pace of the play, and thus end up with an <u>enormously</u> positive experience. Consequently, becoming highly motivated to keep it a secret and continue playing such games with you <u>far</u> into the future, and do that a <u>lot</u>.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This will generally make the children feel comfortable and secure towards what you're doing, even though if they're initially very shy and insecure about it.

                         As soon as <u>you</u> become authoritative and dominating during sexual activities with children, the children will suddenly loose all control. And if they loose their sense of control, such play may become quite negative experiences, even <u>traumatic</u>.

                                   Try being a cool and relaxed adult who lets the children be mostly in control while generally being together and hanging out, without much of restrictions nor boundaries.

                                   The children will then look at you more as one of their <u>own</u> rather than an average adult. This will make all children feel very comfortable towards you in general; and even feel so comfortable that they might seduce you sexually through play and fun, just like kids seduce each other in the same way.

                         Many people who don't know much about child psychology, think that children lack the complex emotions of adults, especially the younger ones. So, it becomes easy for many pedophiles to look at kids as just rag dolls and play toys to throw around and enjoy sexually when it fits the pedophile; and then leave them in the dust afterwards, dirty and used.

                         Actually, children understand a lot more than most think, and much more than they're actually able to express with words, even as toddlers. They have very complex sensations and feelings, at such an intellectual level, that it would probably have scared you if you knew <u>how</u> much.

                         Even a 3 year old is actually capable of sensing that an adult is only using it for its own satisfaction, which can easily make the child feel abused and less worthy.

                         Children who feel abused and less worthy are much more at risk of indirectly revealing that something isn't right, through their daily behavior; even telling about it directly.

                         If you're practicing sex with children close to your own home, or are having longterm sexual relationships with foreign kids, always treat them with care and respect as your <u>first</u> priority. And make all your sexual activities your <u>second</u>.

                         Show a <u>primarily</u> interest in their lives and what they do, while regularly asking if everything is alright. Maybe they need some help with any everyday stuff? Like a bike that needs some fixing or a doll that needs some sewing to be kept together? Play with them, as in non-sexual games that <u>they</u> want to play. Buy them something nice now and then and show them that they are important beings in your life.

                         This will have a <u>huge</u> positive impact on your success and safety as an active pedophile, while it really doesn't cost you all that much when you think about what you'll get in return.

                         Another mistake that many pedophiles do, is to <u>only</u> think about their own sexual satisfaction when having sex with children. They make sure that the child does the right things in the right positions; but when the <u>pedophile</u> gets his release, then everything is over and the activity is done.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Even how well you treat the children, this mistake will make them look at your sexual activities as nothing special nor exciting. Thus with time, they usually loose their interest and motivation to have sex with you, because it really doesn't give them anything special in return.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child has a normal or high libido, make sure to use a lot of time to actually satisfy the <u>child</u> sexually, as well as yourself. Give it orgasms, and make your sexual activities into something delicious and exciting for the child; something that the child can't live without and would like to play all the time.

                         <br />
                         
                         If the child has a weak sexual libido, and don't get horny that easily, compensate by making the activity a very caring and special activity that makes the child feel loved and special. E.g. use warm body oils and massage the child, while having slow sex together, in a warm an cozy environment.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Even if a child shouldn't feel <u>any</u> sexual arousal during a sexual activity, it can <u>still</u> feel very comfortable while enjoying and appreciating your interest and fascination towards its body, and enjoy being the center of your attention.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         By pleasing the children and their bodies, especially when doing long and warm foreplays, you may actually turn an otherwise less horny child <u>on</u>, so it can experience horniness and orgasms for the first time in its life, regardless of age.

                         This will give <u>you</u> a greater satisfaction as well, as it will make your sexual activities generally more profound and sensitive, while building up much stronger releases in the end, as in higher and longer orgasms.

                         When a human being gets sexually turned on and very horny, its behavior changes. It changes to a more aggressive and persistent state, because reproduction is the most important part of nature, and thus needs to be <u>fulfilled</u> when the process first begins. And this process obviously begins when you're about to practice sex with a child as a pedophile.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Not to mention: heavy breathing, moaning and strong shiver, which also are parts of this sexually aroused state.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                             
                         This change of behavior can cause problems when having sex with children, especially during first-time sexual play, because most kids aren't used to this alter ego of the adults.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A common problem is that the child misinterprets the adult's behavior and thinks that the adult is becoming angry or mad; because the child doesn't know what it means for an adult male to be very horny, which usually scares most children; <u>especially</u> when the adult ejaculates and grunts while shivering and handling the child a little bit harder than usual.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A good way to handle this potential problem is first of all to inform the child about this in advance of your activities.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         I will teach you how to do this later in this guide; as it will help the child to understand what happens, and thus be prepared for it and know that it's <u>not</u> about rage, but instead about <u>pleasure</u> that can sometimes be hard to control.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Second, by being aware about this as an adult, you can try to suppress your natural urges, thus control your behavior when you get very horny. This is all about practice; and you can practice this by masturbating to e.g. pictures of children while being <u>very</u> horny, and try making it unnoticeable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And finally, masturbating yourself one time in advance of a sexual activity with a child <u>will</u> make you less sexually aggressive. But unfortunately, it will also make you less horny, thus give you a <u>less</u> experience and orgasm in the end.
                         
                         <br />

                         This problem is especially important for all the newbies to be aware about, <u>especially</u> teen males; as many of them loose all control during their very first sexual activity with a child, and thus end up with a shivering, crying and highly frighted child.
                         
                         <br />

                         It isn't easy beating mother nature. We're basically <u>owned</u> by her and her intentions with our beings. But luckily, we do have <u>some</u> control, and you should use all the control that you've got to make sure you don't scare a child with sexually aggressive and persistent behavior.

                         Most children will sooner or later experience their very first sexual climax and orgasm. It usually happens when they play with their genitals all alone over longer sessions, but it can also happen when they have sexual activities with others.

                         However, all children react differently to their first orgasm:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most experience it as something extremely positive that they would like to do as much as possible. It is not unusual for e.g. 4 year old girls to masturbate themselves to hard orgasms several times a day, just like the older children boys. Thus for some children, this can become a sexual explosion that turns them into true horny, and even seductive, little <u>sluts</u>.
                         
                         <br />

                         Just imagine having a little daughter or girlfriend whom wants you to be all over her all day long! Which can actually happen, because children can become very horny while lacking all kinds of self-control and self-discipline. So, embrace yourself!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         A few children however, experience their very first orgasm as something very negative, usually because they are by nature very skeptical and easily frightened.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The latter children may therefore <u>already</u> have experienced a negative orgasm, which may give them some kind of an anxiety for sexual play. This can be a difficult barrier to break through for a pedophile who wants to seduce such a child, whom don't want to be seduced for this reason exactly.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Those of you with some experience may already have experienced this barrier in one way or another; whether being oversensitivity or fearfulness towards any touching of their genitals, total unwillingness for any sexual play, or that they allow for sexual play to happen, but want to stop as soon as they feel an orgasm coming.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, a frightful first-time orgasm may also happen with a child when you're doing sexual activities together. The orgasm may come quickly and unexpectedly too, especially if your activity has made the kid very aroused.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Females are also hardwired to achieve multiple orgasms during a single session, so they don't get turned off after just one orgasm, thus being capable of keeping on almost forever. But these orgasms can sometimes come so close that it feels like just <u>one</u> large and never ending orgasm, which obviously <u>amplifies</u> a frightful first-time orgasm for a child.

                         The best way to handle this potential problem, is to practice orgasm pedagogy with the children in <u>advance</u> of any sexual activity that will involve first-time fiddle of their genitals. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         They will then learn that sexual arousals and orgasms are to be embraced and enjoyed, not feared and rejected.

                         This can also make orgasms become an important part of your sexual activities, as in something that you both look forward to and aim to achieve during them.

                         Here's an example that you can use to inform any child about arousals and orgasms; which can be used either <u>before</u> a sexual activity is about to happen, or <u>after</u> a frightful orgasm when it lies there in in your arms while shivering and weeping:

                         This is a great little talk that can be used on all children at all ages. It is a basic explanation about arousals and orgasms, but then again being especially crafted to make the children more prepared and less frightened towards either.

                         Sexual arousal among children can be mainly seen by their breathing. You can easily see this by watching a child's chest during sexual activities; even when not touching its genitals, as most children can become sexually aroused by just having their bodies felt and caressed by an adult in an erotic setting.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If a child starts to breathe faster than usual during a sexual activity or setting, it is most likely becoming sexually aroused.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, an increased breathing can <u>also</u> mean that the child is just tensioned or frightened. It usually, and unfortunately, requires some experience to fully know the difference.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also see sporadic and twitching movements of their hips, legs and arms during sexual play, or just by general touches of their bodies. And such movements become harder and more frequent as they get closer to an orgasm.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A very obvious breathing and moaning may also occur, which would be a <u>clear</u> sign of sexual arousal.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Female children are capable of becoming naturally lubricated as soon as they get sexually aroused, while male children will primarily get erections; all of which regards all ages.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Male children arousals can thus be much easier noticed and confirmed; which is why you should use a minimum of synthetic lube on the girls during sexual activities, so you can much easier see their juices come out, thus more easily <u>confirm</u> their arousal.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A child may also become sexually aroused <u>without</u> becoming wet or hard. You will then have to look for breathing and physical reactions only.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The best thing that can happen during sexual play with a child, is that the child gets an orgasm; which is very likely to happen if the child likes and trusts you, and you having created a nice environment while doing things by the book.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The child will become very serious and very focused when closing by its orgasm, and motivated to either be touched or touch itself. The breathing and twitching, and the moans, will be at their highest during the orgasm itself. And you will quickly see that the orgasm has ended when they suddenly and quickly calm down with a relieved look in their faces.

                         Little girls are more likely to get multi-orgasms, meaning that some can continue orgasming several times in a row. The kiddie girls with the strongest libidos can become almost like crazy little porn stars when getting those hard multi-orgasms.

                         There are some insane stories around about super horny little girls, even as young as babies and toddlers, who've cried and moaned for several minutes while having been licked through a long series of hard multi-orgasms; while the pedophiles could almost drink all the pussy juice that poured out of them.

                         Don't expect <u>all</u> of them to breathe, moan and move around all that much though, as some children actually do get pretty quiet and discreet orgasms.

                         <u>How</u> they get an orgasm isn't important, the important thing is that they <u>do</u> get an orgasm during your plays or intercourses.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This is one heck of an experience for a pedophile, especially for the newbies who witness it for the very first time.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And the younger the child, the hotter it gets watching it come. Just imagine seeing a sweet and innocent little doll of a 2 year old girl, lying there like a true little slut while breathing and moaning her way through a hard orgasm. <u>Nothing</u> beats that!

                         I guess the most important question in this regard, is what to do if a child starts to resist an orgasm; whether it is before the orgasm initiates, or during it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You are basically left with just two options; which is either to let the child go, or force it through the orgasm:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="letting_go"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub3">Letting Go</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Your first option is to be kind and tolerant towards the child, thus let the child decide how far it wants to move towards that steep and frightful cliff, before deciding to stop.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And <u>when</u> it decides to stop, you will have to let the child go, as in stopping stimulating its genitals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is the commonly recommended option; bringing us back to that vessel of sex again, which ideally should be controlled primarily by the children, as <u>they</u> are the weakest and most fragile part of your relationship.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will also be the most <u>safe</u> option for you as a pedophile; as your sexual relationship will then be <u>fully</u> based on mutual consent, which will much better preserve your secrets.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, there are some drawbacks with this option:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         By <u>letting</u> the child stop an orgasm out of pure fear, the child won't gain any orgasm experience, which will cause this fear to stay within the child consistently and indefinitely.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Additionally, when you as the adult indirectly encourages a child to keep on fearing something, by letting it stop, a child may actually think that an orgasm really <u>is</u> dangerous.

                         And these drawbacks bring us to the fact that some children may <u>then</u> look at your sexual activities as something risky and dangerous to perform, which may give them a negative relationship towards such activities, which again may cause them to dislike what you're doing.

                         Thus paradoxically, this option may after all not be as safe for you as a pedophile as it initially and logically seems like.

                         And finally, if we're talking about a <u>first-time</u> orgasm here, this option may cause a child to not want to do sexual activities with you anymore; which will destroy what could have been an awesome sexual relationship between the two of you.

                         Simply because: it is <u>allowed</u> to fear orgasms.

                         When a child starts to resist an orgasm, your second option is to actually <u>force</u> the child through it, which can be a good thing for many children who have such an <u>unnecessary</u> fear.

                         This option is thus a cure for all the drawbacks of the first.

                         Some of you may look at this as indecency, or even rape, but it is all about actually <u>teaching</u> and <u>reassuring</u> a child that an orgasm <u>really</u> isn't dangerous to complete:

                         It usually starts to trip its tiny feet, twist it's body, like trying to get away, and beginning to moan and weep simultaneously; but keep on using your adult strength to hold the child tightly and locked within your strong arms, in a caring and loving way, while rubbing its genitals harder and faster, until the child is so afraid that it thinks it's about to die; but <u>finally</u> gets that violent shiver, and gets that wonderful orgasm, for the <u>very</u> first time in its life, along with a relief like no other.

                         These somehow controversial instructions are based on real life experiences from pedophiles and human psychology:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When some young children experience a hard orgasm for the first time: right before the orgasm executes, their brains will think that they're in real danger. They will suddenly feel this unknown and overwhelming arousal, while loosing all control, and instinctively think that they're actually about to die.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is because their brains lack the important experience of <u>completing</u> this otherwise harmless process, and then <u>learn</u> that it isn't life threatening after all.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, most of them will get an <u>enormous</u> rush of adrenaline and happiness when they realize that they actually <u>survived</u> the orgasm. It will be the same experience of a first-time parachuter, surviving that highly exciting and dangerous jump, ending up on the ground super happy and super enthusiastic, all alive and all well, and much ready to repeat that jump and experience all of it once again. And <u>so</u> will the children, the children who survives that first fearful orgasm.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Keep on comforting the child and being there for little her or him, while being fully calm yourself, until it finally starts to breathe normally again and calm all the way down.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you haven't done so already, this is the time to practice that latter orgasm pedagogy; but wait until the child stops crying and shaking, and give it time to calm down before the talk.

                         Unfortunately, this option has its drawbacks as well:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Forcing through a hard orgasm may with some kids backfire, as it may become a little bit too much for them, causing it to become a negative experience <u>regardless</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And this experience can sometimes become so negative that it qualifies as light post-trauma, which will affect the children negatively for an extended period.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will obviously put you as a pedophile at risk, as it will increase the chances of the child telling about it.

                         This may also cause a child to not want to do this anymore.

                         Regarding orgasm resistance among children, there is no correct choice to be made, thus very difficult for me to recommend anything specific, considering all the different children and personalities that are out there.
                         
                         <br />

                         If I <u>am</u> going to recommend <u>anything</u> in that regard, it would be to thoroughly practice the already mentioned orgasm pedagogy <u>before</u> performing any sexual activity with a child, as that will make either choice easier to practice while becoming generally more secure. And when that is said, the first option, as in letting the child go, is probably the safest option for the newbies to choose.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Just don't panic <u>yourself</u> if your child gets a negative orgasm. Stay calm and comforting, while talking to the child as recommended, and everything should be all fine after a little while of sobbing and shivering.
                         
                         <br />

                         Fortunately, and as initially mentioned within this section, the wast majority of children out there will be able to handle orgasms well, and enjoy them enormously. So, any problems related to orgasms among children, regards only a <u>minority</u> of the children, and usually young girls from 3-6 years of age within this minority.

                         Your personal hygiene is <u>extremely</u> important when it comes to intimate relationships between adults and children. If you overlook this important factor, which too many pedophiles unfortunately do, it can actually destroy more than you think.

                         The human body produces odors. Most of these odors are related to bacteria buildups at key places of our bodies: mouth, armpits, genitals and feet. Our bodies do actually clean themselves to a certain degree, but not as thorough as manual cleaning with soap and water.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         We usually don't detect our own body odors that easily, mostly because we easily get used to them. So, even though we <u>think</u> we don't smell that much, we <u>still</u> might.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In the same time, children are <u>extremely</u> sensitive to all odors. Their smell and taste senses are actually oversensitive during their whole childhood. Thus, adult body odors can be easily picked up by these small noses, which most children <u>repulse</u>.
                         
                         <br />

                         Just imagine having a close relationship with a child, and the child senses a strange or bad body odor from you. It can be a bitter aftershave or just odors from plain bacteria buildups. The child will then most likely loose its motivation to be close to you, even try to keep a physical distance, which is a very bad starting point for any intimate relationship.

                         Thus by not being all clean, you may loose the unique chance of becoming seduced by children, and you may be rejected by children whom you try to seduce.

                         A child may also get a bad first-impression of an unclean genital during a sexual activity, making it dislike it <u>indefinitely</u>.

                         Make sure to take a thorough shower, as if you accidentally tripped into a pit of nuclear waste earlier that day. Clean your armpits and genital area especially, including your butt crack. Pull the foreskin of your penis all the way back and clean the penis with genital friendly soap, so it shines like a polished Porsche afterwards. And don't forget your feet.

                         And make sure that you always do <u>all</u> this right before you hang out with children, just in case; especially when you're about to become intimate with a child.

                         I know it may seem stupid of me to tell adult people about something as basic as this, but I really want to emphasize this <u>because</u> of the children's oversensitive smell and taste.

                                   A nice tip if a child is about to play with your penis for the first time, especially suck it, is to clean your penis for a second time during your shower by using a shampoo that smells nice. 
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   When the kid then comes close to your penis, your penis will smell like candy and flowers in the same time, giving the child a really nice first-impression of the penis, while making it much easier convincing the child to suck it nicely and deeply.

                         Dirty children may have some interesting scents that can be sexually arousing for some pedophiles. This can give your sexual activities and intercourses an unique quality.

                         If possible, try this carefully out by omitting intimate care of your little spouse; no toothbrushing nor any bath. But do this with care and only one day at a time, while trying it out.

                         Children usually start to produce sweet mouth and body odors from the age of 3. And these odors will become intensified by the child's age.

                         If you're a person who have sex with lots of different people, whether being with adults or children, with females or males, genital diseases should always be a concern as a pedophile.

                         Many pedophiles have actually gotten caught and sent to jail because they accidentally gave a child a sexually transmitted disease (STD); and for that reason <u>only</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When a child gets an STD, it usually starts out with genital discomfort, itching and pain. If not treated, it will most likely continue and become worse with time. Other adults will sooner or later notice this, thus send the child to a doctor. Most doctors will quickly recognize an STD, which can scientifically prove that the child has been 'sexually abused' by an adult whom has the same disease.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Hell will then break loose: child protective services will be contacted, every male who are or have lately been interacting with the child will automatically become suspects, and the child itself will be thoroughly interrogated by professionals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The risk getting caught will therefore become pretty high.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's also important to note that STDs can also infect a child's mouth, which will become even <u>more</u> apparent.

                         <br />
                         
                         Some STDs are very nasty as well, especially viral STDs, which can infect a child for life; HIV being the worst one with a deadly outcome. In some countries, you can actually get the death penalty for infecting another human being with HIV.

                         If you're very sexually active with other humans, you should always take a control with your doctor before engaging sexual relationships with children; both for your own and the children's sake.

                         <b>The Initiation Process</b>

                         A sexual relationship between an adult and a child has to be <u>initiated</u> before it can be practiced. This initiation process is like a set of starting switches on an engine: you will have to push the right ones in the right order to make the engine run properly and right, whether it is for shorter or longer periods.
                         
                         <br />

                         We're talking about the important <u>transition</u> from a non-sexual relationship, ideally being a nice friendship with trust and intimacy already established, to a sexual relationship between an adult and a child; which may be considered as the <u>seduction</u> part of sexual pedophilia practice.
                         
                         <br />

                         This initiation process is a very delicate operation that many pedophiles rarely think thoroughly about when establishing sexual relationships with children. It requires special techniques and a general finesse to become safe and successful, especially for longterm relationships with children. If this operation is done in a less fortunate way, your new sexual relationship will become less safe and less successful. Or everything can go straight to hell, sooner or later, if you do this all wrong.

                         This may become your most challenging task as a pedophile, but it may also become your most rewarding task ever in life, if you succeed and end up having <u>sex</u> with a little sweetie pie.

                         The initiation process can happen in 3 different ways:

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These are the initiation methods that will be the essential parts of the next sex practice chapters.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is highly recommended that you start with the first method, and only move to the next one if the latter doesn't work.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the third and final method doesn't work, you will simply have to carefully retry it a few times. And if retrying doesn't work, you will simply have to find yourself another child to seduce.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Unless of course, you choose force or rape as a fourth method, as that makes most adults able to consummate a sexual relationship with most children. But neither is supported by <u>this</u> handbook, because of its potential destructive effect on both the children and the pedophiles.

                         <br />
                         
                         The most ideal and recommended way to initiate a sexual relationship with a child, is to wait for the child to seduce <u>you</u>, all by its own motivation and will.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is called a <u>passive</u> initiation, as the adult is the passive initiator, while the child is the active.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This method is so ideal and recommended because the child really wants to do it, and you can be fully sure about that. Since the child is the active initiator, the child will also feel less shame and less as a victim towards your sexual relationship. And all this will make your sexual relationship very secure and successful on a longterm basis, for the both of you.

                         This actually happens more than most think, and it can happen in various ways. It depends on the child's age, gender and personality, and your friendship and environment. Most importantly, it depends mostly on the child's libido, which is the child's own sexual interest, curiosity and needs.

                         It usually happens when a child wants to play sexual games, which many children want to do because of the high level of sexual curiosity existing within them. And playing such games with adults is <u>very</u> enticing, because adult genitalia is generally very inaccessible and forbidden for most children.

                         Being seduced by a child is a process that usually happens gradually over time, as the children usually test a certain adult for his or her reaction to their seductions. If a child senses approval and acceptance from an adult during this process, things can develop <u>quickly</u> towards sexual games.

                         This will obviously require some patience and self-discipline, as the pedophile has to be sexually passive among children while waiting to become seduced. But most pedophiles enjoy spending time with children anyway, while showing them how much they're loved, so it can happen quicker than you think.

                         The reward for this patience can be an <u>ideal</u> sexual relationship with a child, within a frame of safety and success. And that's worth waiting for.

                         Unfortunately, being a passive initiator, as in waiting for a child to seduce you sexually, can be a tedious process with an uncertain outcome; on an indefinite basis.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you don't want to wait for a seduction to happen all by itself, or you've been waiting very long without experiencing any, you do have the possibility to actually <u>trigger</u> a seduction from a child by using some neat tricks.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will be almost identical to the passive approach, except for the need of a little detonator. And detonating a seduction from a child in such a way is very easy and safe to perform, with very high odds of success in the end.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will make the <u>child</u> believe that she or he is the one who actually initiated the sexual relationship, even though <u>you</u> are the one who triggered it. Thus, still making it a passive approach with all of its advantages as mentioned above.

                         Sometimes, even triggering a passive initiation doesn't work as intended nor expected.

                         It may be that the child is very sexually inactive, as in asexual, which some children unfortunately are. It may be that you got limited time alone with a certain child, making the Passive and Trigger approaches less practical. Or it may be that you're simply too impatient to wait for anything to happen all by itself, so you just want to go straight for the action.

                         This is where the <u>suggestion</u> method comes in hand, which is all about introducing a sexual activity or game to a child, and suggesting to perform it together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will be a less ideal approach, because the adult will be the one who initiates the sexual relationship, not the child.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As a result, the child might agree to something that it isn't yet ready to do. Like, if the child is afraid of loosing your friendship, or it looks at you as an authoritative person, the child may agree to almost anything you suggest, regardless of what that suggestion is or what the child really thinks of it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This makes this approach a little bit risky. Because, you may risk initiating a sexual relationship with a child who really doesn't want to do it, but still does of various other reasons; and can even pretend that it wants to do it, making it hard for you to know for sure if this is what the child really wants to do.

                         So, when suggesting sexual activities and games to children, it is <u>very</u> important to already have a nice relationship and friendship in advance, with lots of trust and chemistry.

                         This is the point of child love practice that should make all men very grateful for being born with penises. Having your penis glide into a child, and coming inside it, is the most extreme sensation a pedophile can ever experience in his life. This is one of those things that are almost worth dying for.

Your penis is therefore the only living being that has the unique privilege to enter this hole and peek into heaven itself.

                         Thus, a fully sexual intercourse can happen with most kids, regardless of age and gender, anywhere and instantly, conveniently by penetrating their sweet and wet mouths, through their shiny red lips.

                         Ejaculating into a child's mouth is next to inevitable, especially for the newcomers, if you think about how warm, soft and wet a child's mouth really is, with a little worm of a tongue moving all around in there.

                         If a child should swallow your ejaculated semen, either by accident or intentionally, it can swallow it <u>safely</u> and digest it without any problems afterwards.

                         All children have a swallowing reflex, so even a large surprise ejaculation coming far into their mouths will make them swallow most of it automatically.

                         If they should accidentally get any semen into their air pipes, it will be just like water or yogurt, not pleasant but neither dangerous. They will just cough it back up.

                         Many people aren't aware of it, but the mouth is actually an erogenous zone. This is why intensive kissing, licking and tasting is such sexually arousing and an important part of almost all sexual relationships between all human beings.

                         When an adult male penetrates a child's mouth with his penis, the child may instinctively become sexually aroused, regardless of age and gender.

                         Many toddlers, especially females, have started to touch themselves during oral sex with a male genital; and <u>without</u> having been taught nor instructed to do so. They simply know by instinct that this is sex, thus it turns them on.

                         It means crumbling together in opposite ways to perform oral sex on each other simultaneously, while e.g lying in a bed.

                         By licking the child into arousal and orgasms, the child will become less afraid of and more motivated to suck you deeply until you come far into its mouth. The child may even swallow your semen willingly if you make it <u>very</u> sexually aroused.

                         A mouth is a very intimate and sensitive area, so not all kids will enjoy getting a large adult genital into their mouths; especially not far inside or partially down their throats.

                         This can make it either hard or fully impossible to penetrate certain children orally, because they will reject it.

                         It usually has to do with the size of the cock and the age of the child, as very young children with small mouths will struggle to successfully and comfortably suck large adult males properly.

                         A child's mouth isn't the <u>safest</u> hole to put your penis into!

                         If a child doesn't like what's happening, and it gets very angry, it can actually bite your penis with all its strength. And the consequences of this can be anything from cute bite marks to permanently damaging your penis.

                         First of all, it depends on the state of the penis. An erect penis will be hard enough to stand the pressure and potential harm from a real bite, while a non-erect and soft penis will obviously be way more vulnerable and prone to damage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The head of the penis will always be the most vulnerable part, regardless of its state, as it's tissue is always soft. There have been stories of adult females who have actually bitten penis heads completely <u>off</u> during oral rape; so be careful.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Second, it depends on the child's age and teeth. The older the child, the stronger the bite. And permanent teeth of older children are much sharper and stronger than the round and blunt primary teeth of younger children.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         There's no documentation on children biting adult penises, and the damage effects of such. So, my best advice is to always make sure that your penis is as stiff as possible when you're about to put it into a child's mouth, especially the older and unknown children with permanent teeth who seem less enthusiastic about oral sex; and <u>especially</u> during oral rape.

                         A child's vagina is probably the most special hole of them all for a pedophile adult male to glide into.

                         The vagina is the female reproduction organ that all the way from birth will be an erogenous body part and zone, capable of triggering strong sexual arousals and wetness, along with strong desires and orgasms among <u>all</u> little girls, at <u>any</u> age.

                         Children vaginas are the most clean, delicate and puffy ones, well hidden within Hello Kitty panties and summer dresses, which always smell and taste sweet, and just wait for us pedophiles to touch, taste and slowly glide far inside them.

                         Unlike the mouth and anus, the vagina is actually <u>designed</u> and <u>built</u> by nature <u>especially</u> for sexual intercourses with male penises. It is designed and built for regular penetrations.

                         This makes the vagina rather ideal for sexual intercourses and penetrations, without having to worry about nor struggle with difficulties, complications and security risks.

                         When being in the ideal state for a sexual intercourse, it will consume the end of your penis in a wet and delicious way, not to mention being quite tight to enter, while the child itself will twitch, grunt and moan while you're all over it and making love together as adult and child.

                         The vagina is special, because it isn't designed for sexual intercourses exclusively, it is also designed for <u>births</u>.

                         This makes the vagina <u>extremely</u> elastic!

                         The vagina is almost like a rubber band; it has potential room. When the rubber band is in its default state, it may seem pretty small. But as you start to expand it, like stretching it with your hands, it suddenly becomes much larger. When you let go of the rubber band, it transforms back into its default state, without having been modified nor damaged in any way.

                         This is <u>exactly</u> how a vagina works.

                         When a vagina is in it's default state, it may seem like a tight little hole, almost like a fragile little tube. In reality however, it has the potential to safely become <u>much</u> larger.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When a female is unaroused, her vagina is almost collapsed, so the walls within the vagina actually meet. But even though the vagina is collapsed, just like the rubber band, it has the potential to be opened and widened up; like when a female e.g. inserts a tampon or going through a vaginal examination.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When a female becomes sexually aroused, her vagina will initially expand some all by itself. And in addition to expanding itself, it's potential room inside will increase as well, making it able to much easier take even larger objects inside.

                         <br />
                         
                         Due to this very elasticity, especially when considering births, even young children are fully capable of having successful and harmless sexual intercourses with adult males. But <u>only</u> if it's done through proper and regular training, to make a child's vagina accommodated with an adult male penis.

                         Actually, some of the more experienced adult females actually fist themselves during masturbation, both safely and successfully. And this should be comparable to an average 3-4 year old being safely and successfully fucked by an average adult male. And it can go even larger than that.

                         When a female becomes sexually aroused, her vagina becomes internally lubricated all by itself; and sometimes so lubricated that her vagina starts to drip of wetness.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This wetness is a slimy and oily substance being released from within the vagina walls, during its internal expansion, when the female becomes sexually aroused.
                         
                         <br />

                         This is also like a green traffic light that tells the male that the vagina is now expanded and aroused, and is prepared and ready for a penile penetration.

                         Fortunately for all pedophiles, this function of the vagina is present all the way from birth. Even the vagina of a baby girl will be able to become wet and expanded, and obviously ready for a sexual penetration.

                         And such wetness will, unlike the anus, make you able to fuck horny children for <u>long</u> periods without having to regularly add synthetic lube.

                         Just like with anal sex, but unlike oral sex, you can crumble yourself into a nice traditional position so you can glide into a child while also kissing the child's face and mouth. And generally crumble yourself together into very intimate and tight positions while making love together.

                         You can also use the latter methods to easily lock a child in, so it can't move away if you are being consistent about completing a vaginal sexual intercourse.

                         As recently stated: when a child is sexually aroused, its vagina will initially expand and be able to take much larger objects than normal inside it. It will also become naturally lubricated, which really is the best lubrication for the task. And all this create a nice foundation for successful vaginal intercourses.

                         <br />
                         
                         The child will also be able to handle pain much better while being aroused, and generally be less afraid and more accepting of the insertion of larger objects into its vagina.
                         
                         <br />

                         Unfortunately, making a female child sexually aroused can become a complicated task with unpredictable outcomes:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some children may not be comfortable with the adult in question, or the situation they are suddenly finding themselves within. Others may not be all that sexually active in general, some even totally asexual. And either can keep a child unaroused, regardless of what you do to try arousing it.
                         
                         <br />

                         An unaroused or tensioned child will have its vagina tightened up and dry as a desert. And this will make any penetration (training) difficult and painful for the child at various degrees, and very little effective in the end for the both of you.

                         Most females have a hymen, which is a natural membrane and barrier in front of the vagina.

                         Hymens can sometimes be both sensitive to touch and painful to pass or break through, causing the most chickenhearted children to either resist or reject penetration attempts, whether being penetration training or regular intercourses.

                         Ideal training requires a lot of time, and it requires quality time. This means spending a lot of time with the child while being all alone and private.

                         This is a privilege that some pedophiles simply don't have with certain children, making some of you either less capable or totally incapable of ever having a successful vaginal intercourse with those certain children.

                         And penetrating a child fully without any training in advance will become extremely painful for the child, especially if the child is below the age of 11.

                         Kiddie bums are some <u>truly</u> classical temptations for most pedophiles; and they've been that for centuries, probably since the dawn of the human species.

                         These bums are totally hairless, small and bouncy. They're also very soft, and feel nice to touch. And there's this special hole right in the middle of the buttocks, so tight that it can almost squash your penis flat, almost begging for you to enter.

                         Since the anus is so close to the genitals, it becomes a part of the erogenous nerve system of the genitals, making it pretty sexually sensitive towards fiddle and play.

                         The rectum is also very close to the internal reproduction organs of both females and males. It stays very close to e.g. the prostate of boys, making anal sex capable of triggering orgasms among children boys close to puberty and older. And it stays very close to the internal parts of the vagina, making anal sex possible to trigger strong arousals and orgasms among children girls as well, regardless of the girls age.

                         The rectum is way more elastic than most think. When being properly trained, it can finally take some pretty large objects without problems.

                         Like all body tissue of humans, it can be gradually expanded. You can thus fit larger and larger objects inside it during a certain time of regular and increasingly larger penetrations.
                         
                         <br />

                         So, when proper training is exercised with young children, they will finally be able to take average adult males perfectly, while in the same time enjoying it enormously.

                         Actually, if you start with proper and regular training of a 1 year old, it should be capable of taking an average adult male flawlessly at its 3rd birthday, probably even sooner.

                         It doesn't get any tighter than anal sex. It really makes your penis feel compressed, making it enormously arousing for males to fuck children, with very hard orgasms while really feeling the cum shoot out of you.

                         If the child tightens up its rectal muscles, which happens several times during anal sex, especially if a girl or boy gets an orgasm during the session, it will become even tighter.

                         Just like with vaginal sex, but unlike oral sex, you can crumble yourself into a nice traditional position so you can glide into a child while also kissing the child's face and mouth. And generally crumble yourself together into very intimate and tight positions while making love together.

                         The rectum muscle is designed to lead feces <u>out</u> of the body, while making sure that nothing gets back into it. This is to prevent potential outside toxics and infections from getting into the body's digestion system. This is by design.

                         This design makes the rectum physically reject anything that tries to get inside it. And if you force anything pass this natural barrier, it <u>will</u> become painful while the rectum can be teared at different levels, depending on the treatment.

                         Since any object insertion into the rectum is an unnatural act, as mentioned in the latter disadvantage, such insertions can become quite painful for the ones being inserted, even if the objects are similar to, or smaller than, the size of their feces.

                         And even though the anal is elastic and capable of being expanded over time, it has to be expanded through stretching and tearing only. It doesn't have all that potential room like a vagina does. Such stretching and tearing can become pretty painful, even when it's done in very small increments.

                         Some children are very sensitive and afraid of pain, causing both anal sex <u>training</u> and <u>intercourses</u> to become potentially challenging for some pedophiles to perform and succeed.

                         The rectum tissue is pretty vulnerable to tearing, which can cause several potential health issues among children who're training for, and generally practicing, anal sex with adults.

                         Infection is the most common issue, because most anal trainings of children involve some internal micro-tearing when the rectum tissue is being stretched. This opens a doorway for harmful micro organisms and sexually transmitted deceases to enter the human body; all of which can cause anything from light problems and discomforts to serious and even life threatening problems.

                         Physical damage is a less common issue among careful pedophiles, but it can quickly happen if a pedophile is less experienced in the same time as being very eager and not that careful. Such damages can be cracks, hemorrhoids, prolapses and loss of bowel control; all of which can become serious damages that will later require medical attention.

                                   Any complication or injury caused by anal sex with kids can cause problems that require medical attention, which can scientifically prove that the child has been penetrated anally, and thus become investigated by the law enforcement.

                                   Some complications and injures can also cause permanent damages and health issues for the child in question.

                                   A full tear of the rectum can cause death. A few children have actually died from anal sex with adults, but this is mostly related to hard and assaulting rapes of very young children without any lubrication used. But it can also happen if a child has a dysfunctional rectum or other related health problems that can't be seen or known in advance.

                         Even the most careful training and practice of anal sex with children won't fully eliminate any of the mentioned complications or injuries. It may even trigger unknown problems not mentioned here.

                         <u>But</u>, all complications and injuries related to kiddie anal training, and general intercourses, can be heavily reduced by doing things correctly, which of course I will teach you all about when we get to that part later in the handbook.

                         Ideal training requires a lot of time, and it requires quality time. This means spending a lot of time with the child while being all alone and private.

                         This is a privilege that some pedophiles simply don't have with certain children, making some of you either less capable or totally incapable of ever having a successful anal intercourse with those certain children.

                         And penetrating a child fully without any training in advance will become extremely painful for the child, while being quite dangerous as well when doing it anally, especially if the child is below the age of 11.

                         These chapters have been divided into special age groups, which make sex practice with children easy for me to teach, and easy for you to learn and understand, due to the similarities between the children within each age group:
                         
                         <br />

                              <ul>
                    
                                   <li>Babies and Toddlers <span style="color:gray">(1-3 year olds)</span></li>
                                   <li>Children <span style="color:gray">(4-10 year olds)</span></li>
                                   <li>Adolescents <span style="color:gray">(11-15 year olds)</span></li>
                                             
                              </ul>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Each chapter will be fundamentally different from the others, in both size and setup, as all these age groups of sex practice will be differently practiced.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The most important thing for you to notice in this regard, is that there are some gray zones between these age groups. Like, with some very mature 3 year olds, you may have more success by using the Children chapter instead of the Babies and Toddlers chapter; just like some young adolescents may be too immature for the Adolescent chapter.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Because, and as already taught, children develop differently regarding their bodies, intellects and maturity. So, the latter paragraph regards <u>all</u> children who are at either end between any of these age groups, and something to be aware of and careful about when practicing sex with children in real life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         There may also be certain elements in e.g. the Children chapter that may work successfully on any of the other two, or vise versa; thus I recommend that you read <u>all</u> these chapters and <u>fully</u> educate yourself within sexual child love practice. Because the more you know about this subject, the better you will perform when you move from theory to  practice.

                         And finally, after the age group chapters, we have:
