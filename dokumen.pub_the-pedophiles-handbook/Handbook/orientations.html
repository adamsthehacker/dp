                         Now, as we've established genuine pedophiles, we'll look into some additional sexual orientations related to genuine erotic interests for children.

                         For most people, pedophilia is just pedophilia, a general term for any adult or sexually mature person who have romantic and sexual feelings for underage children.

                         In reality though, and if we get technically and psychologically correct, pedophilia actually covers only 1 specific age group. There are 2 additional sexual orientations to complete the whole age span of childhood in regards to attractions.

                         <br />

                         There are 3 sexual orientations within human psychology that cover all sexual attractions to children:

                         <br />

                         This sexual orientation represents romantic and sexual attractions to very young children, as in babies and toddlers within the age span of 1-3 years, peaking at 1.5 year olds.

                         <br />

                         This sexual orientation is the rarest among all attractions to children, and is considered within psychology as the minority of the minority, if you like. It's also an orientation that not so many have heard about, as it isn't mentioned all that often.

                         While not being fully scientifically confirmed, it has been claimed by several professionals that the majority with this sexual orientation are females.

                         Nepiophilia isn't yet an official term, but is very close to separate itself from standard pedophilia, as its very own and pretty unique sexual orientation.

                         This is the sexual orientation that most of us are familiar with, and the orientation that represents romantic and sexual attractions to middle aged children within the ages of 4-10, with a peak of interest in 7 year olds.

                         It seems to contain as many males as it contains females, though females seem to be less visible because of their inferior sexual urge and activity, and their much better sexual control in general.

                         This sexual orientation represents romantic and sexual attractions to the older children, or adolescents if you want, within the ages of 11-15 years, peaking at 13 year olds.

                         Since most countries practice a 16 year old age of consent, children older than 15 becomes irrelevant in this regard.

                         Just as with nepiophilia, this is also a less known orientation, but it does contain a lot of males and females out there.

                         And of course, it sounds a little bit better than pedophilia.

                         This sexual orientation is extremely rare, and you have probably never heard of it before. But there's still a decent amount of people out there who represent it, mostly females, which unofficially are called super-nepiophiles.

                         This sexual orientation represents romantic and sexual attractions to 'children' in the mid to late teens, approximately between the ages of 16-19.

                         This official sexual orientation is rather useless and irrelevant. Yes, they may be children in the name of the law, but in reality they are fully physically developed young adults. In the same time, being above the legal age of consent in most areas.

                         But it does sort all adults who are exclusively into legal teens. So, you could say that this orientation is here for the sake of sorting and order within psychology.

                         In reality however, there are few to none worries related to being attracted to legal teenagers, even though it may be looked at as somehow controversial if the adult is much older.

                         Most people call all non-pedophiles for heterosexuals. This is actually technically incorrect, which will be further explained later in this chapter.

                         As I recently stated, it's not correct to label non-pedophiles as heterosexuals. Thus, you may wonder where heterosexuality and homosexuality fit within all this.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, heterosexuality and homosexuality <u>are</u> sexual orientations, but they are exclusively gender preferences. So, these preferences can be applied to all other sexual orientations out there:

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A heterosexual male pedophile will therefore be primarily attracted to children girls, while a heterosexual female pedophile will be primary attracted to children boys. Homosexual pedophiles will obviously be the opposite of this.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Bi-sexuality is also a sort of preference, when a person is a heterosexual and homosexual in the same time; in other words, feels just as much attraction to both genders. Though, bi-sexuality isn't exactly what it sounds like, as even bi-sexuals do actually have a primary gender preference.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Pedophiles do have a tendency to be more bi-sexual than teleiophiles, because the gender differences between children girls and children boys are lesser than with adults. This is because children boys have feminine qualities before they reach puberty, especially the younger boys. This also regards children girls with short hair and boyish clothings.

                         These sexual orientations are just <u>primary</u> attraction groups. Nepiophiles may easily have sex with 14 year olds, and hebephiles may just as easily have sex with 2 year olds, or even younger babies. All these orientations do only represent your primary preferred age group that really makes your heart tick and penis grow hard as a brick.
