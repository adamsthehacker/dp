                         All children come in several different shapes and flavors. Many of you, may now think that I'm talking about their looks, but I am actually talking about their <u>inner</u> sides.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         We're not just different on the outside, but also on the inside. And, our 'inner sides' means our <u>personalities</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Your personality is a certain thinking and behavior pattern, based on both your genes and your environment, making you unique in the way you generally act on an everyday basis.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                  
                         Thus, every human is born with certain initial personality traits, while it's upbringing and environment can change these traits some in various directions.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is something that most pedophiles don't think about when they're about to befriend and seduce various children, but <u>really</u> is important to both know and be aware of. Because, every different child, with a different and unique personality, will affect your child love practice <u>differently</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         In other words, there isn't just one sort of children out there. There are many different children out there who think, behave and generally act differently from each other; each one with its own set of unique personality traits.

                                   Please don't feel less about yourself if all this is hard to grasp at once. This is complex psychology after all, and a part of real psychology study. Just read through it, and then come back later and read through it again, and try teaching yourself about this very important subject of different children personalities.

                         You may now think that there are billions of different personalities out there, and how can a pedophile learn and keep track of so many different personalities?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, in some sense that is true, as we're all very different and unique from each other. But, there are just 5 main personality traits among humans, with either a positive or negative value for each main trait, which separate us from each other.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Let's take a look at one example of a main trait:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="list">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                              
                                   <b>Self-Esteem</b> is one of 5 main personality traits.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   <u>Worthiness</u> is its positive value (and a sub-trait).
                                   
                                   <br />
                                  
                                   <u>Unworthiness</u> is its negative value (and a sub-trait).
                                   
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This means that you can build a whole personality profile of a child by selecting only among 10 different sub-traits, which makes this much easier than it may seem like at first.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All this will make much better sense when you now begin learning about each of these 5 main traits:

                         The basis for this personality trait is usually that they really <u>are</u> beautiful children, with parents from the middle to upper class whom can afford to give their children decent clothes and adornments, and parents whom their children are proud of.

                         <span style="color:#00008b">This trait is easily recognizable among children as they got beautiful looks and cool clothes on that are relatively expensive, along with adornments of matching price tags. They're seen among friends almost all the time, as popular, busy and happy children. And they really enjoy showing themselves off through their popular attitudes. This trait will become increasingly visible as they grow older, and already begin showing itself at early elementary school.</span>

                         <span style="color:#006400">If you pour a lot of fuel onto the fire by regularly complimenting their looks and social status, and even buy them nice stuff while saying that they deserve it because they are so special, their hearts can easily be won.</span>

                         <span style="color:#8b0000">Children who know they're beautiful, can easily become pretty arrogant and pompous from early on; and thus become pretty critical to social relationships and <u>whom</u> they accept as friends. They will most likely reject most adults who try to contact or befriend them, unless the adults have stunning looks themselves, are not that old, and own a stunning car. They usually have lots of friends already, along with a romantic partner, and very few drawbacks in life for pedophiles to exploit. They may be considered as <u>winners</u>.</span>

                         Low self-esteem is actually a problem among many children, which leads to the feeling of being non-pretty and non-likable.

                         This is usually related to their real life looks, especially if they got a cosmetic problem, like larger noses or ears than the average children. But it can also be related to poor and/or odd families, making them easy targets for exclusion and bullying. Psychological abuse at home is a rarer reason, but it does happens sometimes, as in parents who patronize their children's looks and general worthiness on a regular basis, which of course destroys all children from within.

They can additionally be spotted easily by the way they look or are dressed, like having cosmetic issues or old clothes on. And of course, they're easy targets for bullies, so you may also see them being bullied, even regularly.</span>

Some of them may even be pretty beautiful, if this trait is based on other negative things rather than their looks.</span>

They may also be so pushed down and into the mud that they actually reject you, because they don't feel worthy enough to be anyone's friend; or they think that you're just messing with them.</span>

                         This trait is usually from a mixture of genes and upbringing. Their parents are most likely confident people themselves, and thus given their children a lot of responsibilities and tasks that they've successfully accomplished and gotten rewarded for; and all this from very early on in their childhood.

                         <span style="color:#006400">The main advantage for pedophiles is little fear of strangers and their suggestions and dares, as these kids think they can handle most things all by themselves, without any advisory. Neither do they fear doing unusual stuff, which of course includes sexual activities. They're also known to have a very high threshold and endurance regarding pain, making sexual penetrations more convenient. They can be easily dared to do crazy things, by using neat tricks that you'll see later in the handbook. They are simply pretty rough children who are easy to seduce and can stand a lot before they break. And even if they do break, they rarely get traumatized by it. They also tend to be good secrets keepers.</span>

                         This trait is usually from a mixture of genes and upbringing, just like its opposite sub-trait. Their parents are most likely pretty much the same, and overly protective. These children aren't used to challenging responsibilities nor such tasks, and expect adults to always be around for help and salvation.

They're not necessarily loners, thus <u>can</u> be seen in social groups, but usually as one of the underdogs. They can also be noticed by their very impatient behavior and quickly giving up during challenging tasks, even though they could've completed them.

                         <span style="color:#8b0000">It will be very hard to accomplish contact with these children and befriend them, especially if you're a stranger. They usually pick their friends with extra care, and only pick a few, even if they're lonely. Their overly protective parents have most likely told and scared them to avoid strangers anyway.

                         Not to mention, having been told and scared by their parents to avoid being touched at private areas of their bodies. They will generally be very skeptical and avoiding, and flimsy and unmotivated, during most sexual play. They're easily scared and do easily cry from even the slightest feeling of insecurity, discomfort or pain. They usually cry a lot, and can even cry without any real reasons. They also tend to fear sperm and penetrations during sexual activities. They're therefore more likely to dislike both you and your sexual activities unless you're super careful and know the child well. They're also more likely to reveal your illegal activities and secrecy.</span>

                         These children are very outgoing, as in easily making contact and friendships with other children and adults, while also being very socially initiative and active. And, socially curious.

                         This trait is most likely based on genetic inheritance. But, it can also have something to do with having met a lot of different and kind people during their upbringing, thus having been taught social skills <u>and</u> the false reality of all people being all friendly and all safe, all the time. Their parents are most likely naive and trusting towards other people, or pretty much ignorant in that regard.

                         <span style="color:#00008b">These children are easily recognizable by their contact seeking and open social behavior, like saying hello to strangers that pass by, or even begin just talking to them. They usually have lots of friends, because of their social skills and outgoingness. And other children tend to look up towards them as well. But a few of these children can also be loners, even victims of bullying, and thus become <u>extremely</u> contact seeking and open towards strangers.</span>

They will also be very easy to be around and talk to, as they like talking and have lots to talk about. Seducing these children sexually is generally not a problem.</span>

                         <span style="color:#8b0000">They usually have lots of friends around them, sometimes even more than they can handle, and thus be challenging to contact alone.

                         These children are very ingoing, as in quiet and antisocial. They don't necessarily have any low self-esteem nor insecurities, they simply don't appreciate nor need much of social activities in their lives. They're widely known as loners.

                         Just as its opposite sub-trait, it's most likely based on genetic inheritance, thus being a basic personal preference for loneliness, which most of them actually enjoy. Of course, upbringing may also have something to do with this, like having met very few people during their early childhood, except for their parents, and never visited any play groups or daycare; thus not had their social skills stimulated much.

                         <span style="color:#00008b">These children are easily recognizable from their apparent loneliness, as in traveling alone to school and playing alone around in the neighborhood. They're also easy targets for bullies, since they are such antisocial beings; so they can be picked on a lot, which also is easily noticeable.</span>

                         <span style="color:#006400">You will very easily spot these children outdoors, even from long distances. And by being so much alone, they can much safely and conveniently be approached and contacted. Even though they are loners, they may still appreciate a special friend that respects them and accepts them for who they are. They also tend to have secret places outdoors that they use alone, which are ideal places for seduction and sex.</span>

                         <span style="color:#8b0000">They will of course not be all that easy to befriend initially, as they won't have much of social needs nor skills. They may even seem unfriendly because of their lacking social skills. And when you <u>do</u> successfully contact them, it can be hard having conversations with them, as they often tend to be generally quiet and less chatty.</span>

                         The reason for this personality trait is almost always based on genetics, as there are few ways for parents to upbring a child to become naturally dominant. This trait can already be seen among young toddlers and how they interact with others.
                         
                         <br />

                         These children are also more likely to develop psychopathy, as in becoming sociopaths.

                         <span style="color:#00008b">Believe me when I say that you will quickly notice these kids, especially when interacting with them. But you will also see them from a far distance in the way they interact with other children, being the natural born leaders who pave way for their followers to follow behind. They talk the loudest and talk the most, and stands out like a pink xenon light at night. They are usually to be found in groups of children, leading them by either earned respect or pure fear. But, some of them can become too dominating, or less socially skilled, and thus repel children instead of attracting them, and thus end up as loners, many of which end up being bullied.</span>

                         <span style="color:#006400">If you find a dominating child whom is friendless, contacting it and befriending it should be easy as pie; as long as you either <u>are</u> or <u>play</u> an underdog, thus let the kid run the show and thrive as a leader; even though if the child is very young. You can <u>still</u> control the child without it knowing it, by using certain advanced tricks that we'll go through later. This can lead to many and very interesting things, especially if the child learns to enjoy sexual play, as it will then tear you to pieces sexually and give you the ride of your life. They will control most of your sexual relationship, which can be very advantageous and exciting being a part of. And memorable!</span>

And the older they get, the more frightening they become, as in very dominating and less controllable, with very little respect for adults and authorities. Befriending them can thus become very challenging, especially if they already have enough friends and respect.

                         When they say stop, which can happen anytime and usually at the least suitable moment, they mean <u>stop</u>. Unless you rape them against their will, this can become a huge frustration during sex practice. And even if they do what you want them to do, they may still insist on doing certain things differently, which <u>you</u> don't want to.

But as you get closer, and interact with them especially, you will quickly notice them as the true little angels they really are, at least most of the time.

Their kindness will also make them convenient to befriend. And when treated very carefully and nicely, rich and powerful sexual relationships without any complications can be easily accomplished. And they will just keep on doing it until <u>you</u> say stop and until <u>you</u> are satisfied and relieved. They may even satisfy your sexually from their very kindness alone. And most importantly, they are <u>very</u> good secret keepers.</span>

This means that they may do things against their own will, but pretend that they like it, because they either like you or fear rejecting you. This can become a potential huge drawback, because this may make them dislike what you do, while showing the opposite, which increases the likelihood of telling about it and thus sending you to prison, while <u>you</u> thought everything was okay(!). Extraordinary care, and ideally some experience, is therefore recommended before having sex with these little angels.</span>

                         Intelligence is born-with, and has nothing to do with a child's upbringing. Parents may give their children lots of knowledge, regardless of their intelligence, but knowledge has nothing to do with intelligence. Knowledge is like the hard drive in your computer, while intelligence is like the CPU; two completely different components in other words.

                         <span style="color:#00008b">These children are quite difficult to spot from a distance, actually next to impossible. Though, the super intelligent ones tend to become loners and oddities in social groups, but this can also be of other reasons. Well, if you're a sucker for cliches, a boringly dressed boy or girl with thick glasses could be a giveaway, of course. You will much better notice this trait when interacting with them or being close enough to see how they interact with others. You can almost notice it in the way they look at you, as in not looking <u>at</u> you, but rather <u>through</u> you. They are usually way more mature than similarly aged children, and thus act like they're several years older than they really are. Their speech and processing power will be noticeably advanced, especially during conversations.</span>

                         <span style="color:#006400">Very intelligent children are either rejected from social groups with averagely smart children, or they leave those groups willingly, because of mismatching intelligence and interests. They become thus loners against their own wishes and will, making them extraordinarily in need of friends, who'll be hard to find. <u>However</u>, very intelligent children will feel very comfortable among averagely intelligent adults, since their intellects will actually match; at least until the child outgrows the adult intellectually. And this is the reason why these children actually prefer to and tend to have more of adult friends rather than children friends. They are also curious by nature, and have weird hobbies, so <u>sex</u> may grab their interest as a subject to learn and explore with a pedophile adult. And I must not forget: they are also very romantically developed, and far above similarly aged children. And they are usually <u>exceptional</u> secret keepers 
                         at most ages.</span>

                         <span style="color:#8b0000">They can actually become a little bit too smart, thus not that easy to fool or mislead, and be able to see straight through your body and soul. High intelligence will also make them cautious, suspicious, skeptical and sense things you never could imagine a child of that age was ever capable of sensing. This can make you feel less comfortable as a pedophile, espeically when trying to seduce the kid sexually.</span>

                         Intelligence is a very sensible subject, as no one likes to be called stupid. But there <u>are</u> human beings out there with less intelligence than average, which include children.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Always keep in mind though, that those with the least amount of intelligence, are usually those being most happy and less concerned in life, which could be considered as a gift, really.

                         <br />
                         
                         For pedophiles, such children can be considered as living gifts of flesh and blood, as they are extremely easy and comfortable to be around, and open minded to almost anything without thinking twice about it. They are mostly happy with a positive mood, and just love life without worrying about it all that much, nor much of what's within it.

                         <span style="color:#00008b">Just as with intelligent children, it is quite hard to spot unintelligent children from a distance. They do additionally blend well with the majority, and are usually a part of large social groups, making them even more difficult to spot. But their lacking intelligence will be gradually revealed as soon as you begin interacting with them, or are able to see them interacting with others close by. You will then notice that they laugh a lot and act silly, don't take things all that seriously, having a hard time being serious at all, and generally seem pretty careless without thinking things thoroughly through.</span>

                         <span style="color:#006400">These children are especially easy to seduce sexually. They can just jerk off adults, even strangers, just for fun, and scream and laugh while their penises shoot sperm all over the place. They can also suck adults off as well, with similar results. Just like that! They rarely take things any seriously, and just do whatever seems to be presently funny and exciting. They can just as easily be lured here and there, especially with candy or toys. They just don't think about the consequences about what they're doing, and neither do they care. This makes them some highly interesting little beings for pedophiles, with the famous nickname: sluts; all the way from babyhood to adulthood.</span>

                         <span style="color:#8b0000">Well, by not taking things very seriously, nor being able to understand consequences of things, they might actually be the first ones to tell about what you've done together, in one way or another. So, these children can quickly become free tickets to prison, and usually recommended to exploit only when hunting outdoors as a stranger pedophile; especially when dealing with the least intelligent ones.</span>

                         All children, and all human beings, have all these 5 personality traits that together builds your distinctive personality. You can thus pick all 5 personality traits when analyzing a human being, but each trait can <u>either</u> be positive or negative.

                         <br />

                         Please note that either of these 5 main personality traits doesn't have to be either fully positive or fully negative:

                         Try imagining a long line. At the left end of this line you see the positive value, and at the far right you see the negative. Any of these 5 main traits may exist on any place on this line, either at either far end, or somewhere in between the two.

                         As soon as you understand and remember all these traits, you will suddenly start seeing children differently, whether being children you already know or little strangers outdoors. With time and practice, You will be able to see the personality traits of all children, and thus know what their pros and cons are, and how easy or difficult it will be to approach and contact them, or even seduce them, <u>just</u> by watching how they interact with other children and behave in general.

                         The more your see of a child, and the longer you survey her or him, the better you will learn its personality to know.

This is actually pedophilic science, which few pedophiles use to their advantage. But it <u>does</u> require practice, so please be patient while trying to analyze children. This is actually fun!

                         It is very hard for me to say what's an ideal child is for <u>you</u>. However, some combinations of traits are more ideal than others; and here's one combination that I think would be very ideal for all pedophiles to pursuit, espeically the newbies:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         A child that feels <b class="h">unworthy</b>,
                         
                         <br />
                         
                         but has a basic level of <b class="h">confidence</b>.
                         
                         <br />
                         
                         It is located somewhere near of <b class="h">ingoing</b>,
                         
                         <br />
                         
                         is quite <b class="h">obedient</b>,
                         
                         <br />
                         
                         and has a little more than <b class="h">average intellect</b>.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This will give you a child whom will more likely be without many friends, thus appreciate a new one who complements it, cares for it, and touches it in a special way. It will be easy and convenient to approach and befriend it as a stranger, and it will be willing to please you sexually. It will also be smart enough to understand and respect secrecy and the social consequences of revealing any illegal activities that you do.
                         
                         <br />

                         You can play around with these personality traits yourself, and look at their pros and cons to find a model that works best for you and your own personality and preferences. And then prioritize that model when you're about to find a child for child love practice. It doesn't have to be a perfect match, but just a baseline to follow so you will stay comfortable and secure.
