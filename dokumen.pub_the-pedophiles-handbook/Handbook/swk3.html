                         Welcome to the third and last chapter of this guide that will teach you the basics about how to practice sex with children.

                                   This chapter covers children in the ages between 11 and 15, being geared towards 13 year olds, which is the standard age preference for <b>hebephiles</b>.

                         Adolescents are special, because they're no longer <u>kids</u>. They are no longer the main sexual attraction of nepiophiles and pedophiles, but rather the attraction of hebephiles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Adolescents can be considered more as young adults rather than children, as they will quickly and drastically mature both physically and mentally from the age of 11 and on.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Such a development will make them both harder <u>and</u> easier, in the same time, to seduce and make love to:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         What makes things harder, is how the clean and pure minds of children becomes affected by the distorted and unhealthy view that the modern society has towards human sexuality. Shyness and shame towards sex will thus increase as they grow, and most adolescents will <u>already</u> be considerably affected by this change at the beginning of this stage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A consequence of this is that they will loose that free and open minded relationship towards sex, like the younger children have, making them less likely to do crazy and impulsive stuff to seduce adults, while ending up much more cautious towards sex in general and much more afraid of the pedophilia hysteria in our society; all of which make things more challenging and complicated for the hebephiles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Adolescents do also use a way more <u>indirect</u> way to sex than the younger kids, especially the girls; as most of them will take a route through <u>romance</u> before they continue towards <u>sex</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And they require more of you, like youth, great looks and high status. And if you lack either in a big way, you may want to consider the latter age group with younger children instead, which is a far less demanding age group. Unless of course, you are primarily looking for horny adolescent <u>boys</u>, or adolescent girls with severe personal problems; as the latter will be much easier to befriend and seduce as an older and not so good looking adult with low resources.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         What makes things easier however, is the adolescents sudden and very high <u>independence</u>. This makes it <u>very</u> easy and safe for all hebephiles to find and contact them outdoors. It will also be <u>much</u> easier to make plans, dates and hang out with them, without their parents noticing it that easily. Not to mention that secrecy does actually <u>not</u> have to be practiced nor become any significant worry for most hebephiles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         They're also much more stable and predictable than any of the younger children, making things very safe and comfortable for the newbies.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The most <u>important</u> advantage with adolescents is that they're entering <span class="glow_red">puberty</span> at the beginning of this stage, somewhere around 11. Puberty means horniness, and puberty horniness is the strongest and highest horniness there is. When the humans are in puberty, they're more horny than they'll ever be in life. And such horniness can easily make them do crazy stuff without thinking thoroughly about it. Though, it can also make them easily regret things afterwards, so you still need to be careful when exploiting it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Don't let the disadvantages scare you too much. Consider this: adolescents are generally way more available and easier to find, and way safer to try seducing, that the positive sides of this group kind of equalize the negative, making this group actually a very interesting group for the nepiophiles, pedophiles and hebephiles alike, to explore and exploit; even for the teleiophiles who are mainly attracted to adults.

                         And just as with the younger children, there will always be adolescents out there with personal problems at various degrees. Personal problems equal weaknesses, which can be exploited by hebephiles to more easily befriend and seduce them. You see, puberty <u>is</u> a very challenging period for an average adolescent, with many potential problems and pitfalls, while some will have even more problems on the top of that, all of which make some of them <u>very</u> manipulatable.

                         They also have general weaknesses related to their age that make things easier for hebephiles in general.

                         My intention with this chapter is to exploit their weaknesses to help you seduce them and enjoy them; their main weakness being the unique combination of independence, freedom <u>and</u> the lack of experience and critical thinking. Hopefully, this will help you enter their sexy panties and tiny bras, and access their fresh genitals and firm breasts; almost like getting into a brand new Ferrari, straight from the fabric.

                         Another nice thing about adolescent <u>girls</u> is that they don't need any excessive penetration training for vaginal sex, thus they can be fucked at once, like in the backseat of your car. Of course, with lots of lube and patience with the very youngest.

                         Younger children are very easy to befriend and seduce, because they simply don't care about how you look and act, neither about your economical and material status.
                         
                         <br />

                         But we're not talking about young children anymore!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         As already stated, most adolescents will require more of you to let you befriend them, especially make love to them. They will primarily require youth, great looks and high status, because this is important to them and their own social status.

                         Thus before we move to the initiation of sexual activities, I will first use some time to teach you how to quickly and efficiently become more attractive among adolescents, based on my own professional and private experience:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="presentation_and_attention"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub2">Presentation and Attention</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The first and initial advice I can give you, is to think about <u>how</u> you are presenting yourself among both adolescents you know and don't know, thus <u>how</u> you draw their attention.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Why should a particular adolescent show <u>any</u> interest in <u>you</u>, over all the other adults surrounding her or his life?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The first thing you will need to do, is to make yourself a physically <u>interesting</u> person who're not like everyone else. And the most interesting adults, in an adolescent's eyes, who will stick out from the boring majority <u>and</u> seem much younger than they actually are, are first of all the ones who dresses themselves in cool and trendy clothes. This is <u>very</u> important!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         By exercising and building up your visible muscle mass some, while getting a moderate suntan, which are easy to obtain, will additionally make you look a lot better. However, <u>this</u> is strictly not necessary, only an optional but helpful add-on.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Add some nice adornments too, like trendy sunglasses, a nice but discreet gold necklace, and a cool watch.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This may sound stupid to some of you, and may not be <u>you</u> at all. But this isn't about changing yourself and who you are, it is all about using a temporary <u>tool</u>, while hanging around adolescents, to get their attention and appreciation, so you can get into their soft and white panties. It's almost like the clothing and makeup actors use when they go on stage, which they take off and change back when they go home.

                                   Actually, I once did an experiment with this:
                         
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   There where this regular hangout, at a small fast-food restaurant, with adolescents between the ages of 12 and 14. Every time I passed by them by foot, as a boring and averagely looking middle aged guy, I seemed just as interesting to them as the trash bin standing 2 feet away from them. Actually, the trash bin got way more attention than I did.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Another day, I came with new clothes and adornments, as explained above. I even added an iPod for the sake of fun. And almost all of them stared at me while I passed by. It was almost like if I where a new guy in town, even though I had been passing by them for months in advance. Two girls continued to look at me through the glass of the shop.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   And please note that I'm not a looker. Neither am I muscular nor tanned. The trendy clothes and the few adornments used, which actually wasn't all that expensive either, grabbed their attention in a positive way.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   I continued showing up every day around 6 pm for a week, while making some small changes to my clothes each day; and at the last day of the experiment, the group actually made contact by asking me where I'd bought the jacket I was currently wearing, and how much it costs. They additionally complimented my clothing in general.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   This was only <u>one</u> experiment, and I may have been lucky, but it proves to me that <u>just</u> wearing the right clothes and adornments within an environment of adolescents, is actually <u>enough</u> to have at least <u>some</u> of them contact you in a positiver way.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   <u>If</u> I had continued this experiment, I'm very sure that a particular girl among that group, who smiled at me with a shy face, would finally have approached <u>me</u>. Or, she would've been an easy target for me to have approached.
                                        
                              </div>

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A nice sports car is probably the most effective magnet to attract adolescents, as they <u>love</u> cool cars, girls as boys.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may think that a cool car <u>have</u> to be expensive, but it really doesn't. It's all about choosing the <u>right</u> car; and such a car can cost as little as $5000, and be generally cool to own as a second car and free-time cruiser anyway.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Don't forget to act cool and kind. A nice personal appeal goes <u>well</u> with trendy clothes and adornments, and can even be a substitute for that at some level. Some girls, both adolescents and adults, may actually fall in love with your <u>personality</u> instead of your looks; so tune up your charm and kindness when communicating with them.

                         <u>Never</u> underestimate the way you present yourself among adolescents, whether being outdoors and hunting, a school teacher, a step dad, or a big brother. Make yourself <u>attractive</u> and <u>cool</u>, and someone whom they're <u>proud</u> to hang with.

                         When talking to adolescents whom you yet don't know that well, make sure that your intentions for talking to them are clearly based on friendship, not romance. Try to find similar interests to talk about, and avoid being pushy if they seem shy or insecure towards you. Just be patient and respectful.

                         Never act too serious, and neither take things too seriously, when being among adolescents. It's <u>very</u> important that you act like one of their own, rather than one of their parents. Notice: adolescents <u>hate</u> their parents and <u>love</u> their friends!

                         And by not being too serious, you will more easily make them laugh, which will make you <u>cool</u>. So don't be afraid of using your sense of humor and being a little bit crazy.

                         <u>Compliments</u> and <u>flatter</u> will probably be the most important tools you can use to melt their hearts, especially the girls; because many of them are quite insecure, which is a default psychological trait among puberty girls. They will therefore absorb either, like a dry and hard sponge would absorb water.
                                             
                         <br />

                         Flattering the girls with flowers and non-sexualized poems is also an effective tool to gain their love. This is a nice and legal way to flirt with them, and thus check them out to see if you get any positive responses; after having been friends for a while. Adolescent females will appreciate such flirting way more than any adult female will, as their insecurities and romantic feelings will be hugely amplified by their puberty.

                         <u>However</u>, be careful about using compliments and flatter: when using either in the wrong way or too much, it will have the opposite effect of making yourself attractive.

                         And <u>romantic</u> flatter should <u>only</u> be used on girls, unless you suspect or know that an adolescent boy is gay, <u>or</u> you're a female hebephile who're into young boys. The boys are next to non-romantic, while most won't appreciate any of such from adult males if they're straight themselves.

                         <u>And</u>, be careful about using <u>erotic</u> compliments and flatter too early, as that might reveal that you're only in it for the sex, while also risking appearing like a sleaze.

                         So, always stick to <u>decent</u> compliments at the <u>early</u> part of new social relationships with adolescents, like complimenting their personalities, clothes and hair; and other non-sexual elements. Later in the relationship, when you know each other better, and especially after having gotten positive feedback from non-sexualized flirting, move towards more erotic compliments, like the beauty of their faces, lips and bodies.

                         Make them feel <u>special</u> and taken <u>cared</u> of. Make them feel that there's a guy out there who thinks about them all the time, who would do <u>anything</u> for them at <u>any</u> time, and someone who places them in the <u>very</u> center of his life.

                         Finally, try to <u>impress</u> them some, <u>without</u> being too apparent and cocky. Adolescents are <u>notorious</u> for accepting bullshit, so you may lie a lot about your past and what you've done and achieved. You may even lie about who you are and what you do currently, as long as it can't be easily revealed. The best thing is, of course, to <u>really</u> have something solid to impress them with, like money, cars, electronics, and anything that equals status for an average adolescent. But, lying works well!

                         A much used trick among hebephiles to both attract adolescents and keep them close by, is to be regularly generous with gifts and money.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is in some ways similar to child prostitution, but being a far less obvious and dirty way of whoring themselves.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You don't actually have to be rich to practice this, because the average adolescent lacks cash big-time. They're basically poor and totally dependent on regular fees from their parents, which isn't much in the end. So, making them happy with gifts and money doesn't require all that much of expenses.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, please note that it is usually quite difficult knowing what sort of <u>product</u> gifts these picky creatures appreciate; as even their parents can struggle with this. But, if you are a male who's dealing with an adolescent girl, there are three gift products that never fail, in the same time as being very flattering and romantic: flowers, chocolate and jewelries.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The gifts that <u>never</u> fail, regardless of age and gender, are <u>money</u> gifts; which I always recommend if you are new to this, or simply unsure about what to buy your sweet youngster.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, alcohol and cigarettes are very popular products among the older adolescents, regardless of gender, which they obviously aren't allowed to buy due to being underage. Such gifts will <u>really</u> up your cool factor.

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                                                  
                         Gifts and money will make it generally easier for you to eventually get into their sweet smelling panties, as this can eventually become a way for them to sort of prostitute themselves, without actually prostituting themselves in the official and traditional sense.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, if you're dealing with an adolescent girl whom has a crush on you, her crush on you and dependence to you will only become stronger.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It becomes even more effective if you start ignoring them if they reject your flirting, and give them lots of attention and <u>earnings</u> for allowing you to become intimate, making them realize that giving you intimacy is the <u>only</u> way to keep you and your important earnings in their lives. Of course, with the risk of making them feel used, which sometimes can lead to negative consequences in the future for the both of you.

                                   When purchasing <u>expensive</u> gifts to adolescents, it may attract negative attention and suspicions from their parents. Even though these children are very independent, they're still under strict supervision in general.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Some physical gifts can also be tracked back to you if they are unique models or have serial numbers on them; unless you buy them <u>anonymously</u> with <u>cash</u> far away from home.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Avoid purchasing electronic gifts and using electronic payments, as both can make it easy for the LEA to track you down <u>or</u> use it against you as evidence later in life. Neither transfer money to their bank accounts.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   A nice solution to these problems is to give the adolescents <u>small</u> but <u>regular</u> quantities of <u>physical</u> money instead. Then they can buy themselves whatever they want to, and nothing can nor will be tracked back to you if you're careful about it; neither will it attract that much attention.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Buying alcohol and smoke to minors is a criminal offense in most countries, which all by its own can send you to prison if you get caught for it. Though, these products are usually hidden from their parents and quickly consumed anyway. But still, be careful about leaving your fingerprints on such gifts.

                         Adolescents are <u>notorious</u> for having personal problems. And this is <u>very</u> important for hebephiles to be aware of when searching for these kids to seduce and have sex with them.

                         First of all, puberty will mess up their emotions, making them confused and insecure about themselves and others:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can easily cause them to choose adult partners, even same gender adult partners, for romance and sex.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Many of them also turn into rebellions, rebelling their parents and the whole world. And finding an adult partner, and doing something <u>bad</u> with him, will satisfy those rebellious needs.

                         Girls are likely to develop a distorted body self-perception, which obstructs their sexual freedom and exploration among similarly aged; making them search for adult partners instead, whom aren't that picky about looks and physical flaws.
                         
                         <br />

                         Some adolescents have additional problems in their lives, which makes adult male role models very important to them:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A quite common problem actually, is the lack of a father, in one way or another. Many fathers don't care all that much about their children, or they are very old-fashioned and uncool. And some adolescents don't even have a father at all, whether he left them years ago or tragically passed away.
                         
                         <br />

                         A caring and cool father is <u>extremely</u> important for all adolescents, girls as boys; so those who lack this, will become <u>very</u> attracted to a caring and cool hebephile whom makes them the very center of his life.
                         
                         <br />

                         There are <u>lots</u> of young fatherless girls and boys out there!

                         Finally, there's a quite large amount of adolescents out there who simply don't fit in, of various reasons, making them outsiders among similarly aged, and thus very contact seeking towards adults and all the wrong people you can imagine; as in <span class="glow_yellow">special adolescents</span> if you like.

                         Either of these problems, or a combination of several, usually leads to adolescents either <u>seducing</u> adults in various ways, or makes it easy for adults to seduce <u>them</u>. So, I always recommend finding yourself a troubled adolescent, as these will much easier let you come close to them, and inside them, in one way or another; <u>just</u> like the troubled children of the latter and younger group.

                         This is the initiation process of sexual child love practice, where we'll attempt to initiate sexual activities with adolescents.

                         It is very important that you know how this process works, as already <a class="set3" href="swk_prep.html#the_initiation_process" target="_blank">explained</a> in the latter preparation chapter.

                         The first thing I will say about adolescents in this regard, is that they're now entering a development stage that will cause them to <u>truly</u> and for the first time in life understand the link between romance and sex. They will suddenly realize, at the beginning of this stage, that romance and sex are linked, and that it all <u>begins</u> with romance and falling in love.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Adolescents will thus be more focused on romance and love rather than pure sexual curiosity, in the same time as being less crazy and much calmer, than the younger children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;                         
                         <br />
                         
                         The consequence of this development is that adolescents will more likely seduce cross gender adults, and more likely start this seduction with a romantic interest and behavior.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         In other words, when an average adolescent seduces you, everything will go much slower; usually starting with a friendship, which eventually develops into romance, and finally sexual activities in the longer run.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Unfortunately, and unlike the younger children, average adolescents, and girls especially, tend to have their romantic and sexual focus <u>primarily</u> set on the similarly aged, rather than the much older.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I've heard several adolescent girls say: "Ew, he's too old!", and the poor guy was only 30 years old. Just take a look at the Justin Bieber hysteria among these girls; he's young and hot, not fat, bald, and with wrinkles.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I don't want to offend anyone, of course; but we <u>have</u> to be honest and realistic when dealing with these kids.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, while being honest and realistic: if you <u>are</u> relatively young and hot, and own a cool car, you will obviously not meet all that much of obstacles in this regard. If you are at the other end however, you will simply have to look out for those exceptions out there, as in <span class="glow_yellow">special adolescents</span>.

                         <span class="glow_magenta">Adolescent girls</span> will more likely seduce adult males through romance, as in falling in love with them.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is usually a very gradual and slow process that begins with the adolescent showing an apparent interest in being among and hanging out with the adult in question; but not necessarily talking to the adult in question at once.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The adolescent will then try communicating with the adult, but usually in an indirect way, especially if the young girl has a shy and ingoing personality.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the adult male shows a similar interest for the adolescent, a friendship <u>should</u> start to develop.

                         <br />
                         
                         This friendship will, physically wise, become closer and more intimate with time, and gradually develop into romance and flirting with touching, hugging and eventually kissing.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The adolescent will usually be the primary motivator, while the adult only needs to <u>allow</u> for this to happen, simply by being friendly and open towards this special relationship. But if the kid is very shy and ingoing, or abnormally insecure, the adult <u>will</u> have to take some steps and actions to succeed.

                         Well, adolescent girls may <u>also</u> sexually seduce adult males in a quicker and more direct way, as described below with adolescent boys; though this is more rare.

                         <span class="glow_blue">Adolescent boys</span> are just as capable of seducing adult females as the girls are capable of seducing adult males, as written above. However, the boys will more likely skip the romance part, and thus seduce adult females in <u>way</u> more efficient and quicker ways.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, adolescent boys will more likely seduce same gender adults, as <u>they</u> will more likely be hanging out together; which usually isn't based on romance, but rather on pure sexual curiosity, exploration, and horniness.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Such seductions usually start out by the adolescent introducing sex related humor to the adult. This humor may slowly develop into more <u>serious</u> conversations about sex and genitalia, like the adolescent asking questions of such.
                         
                         <br />

                         Adolescent boys are also very interested in pornography, and may thus ask if you got any of such; which can easily lead to watching porn together, which again can easily lead to jerking off tougher, which once again may gradually lead to sexual activities. Actually, this <u>is</u> a quite common phenomena among adolescent boys who watch porn together, thus an adult male hebephile can easily become a part of this.

                         Play fights can also develop into a seduction, if the fight becomes genitalia focused. They may tickle, pinch or punch your genital area for fun, which can become an open invitation to sexual play.

                         The younger adolescents, like the 10-12 year olds, may also spontaneously show their genitals in some circumstances, which obviously is a clear seduction.

                         <span class="glow_orange">Generally spoken</span>, <u>all</u> adolescents are highly capable of seducing adults in various ways. And such seductions can easily lead to sexual play, and a sexual intercourse in the end; as long as <u>you</u>, the adult hebephile, are <u>totally</u> open and acceptant towards such behavior and seductions.

                         Just like adults, the adolescents have regular sexual needs, based on hormones, that needs to be regularly satisfied. Thus, when you want to trigger a seduction from an adolescent, it will be all about doing certain things that will turn the adolescent's sexuality on; in the same time as making your environment as arousing and exciting as possible.

                         And of course, an adolescent may already <u>want</u> to seduce you, but doesn't dare too. Thus all you need to do is to make it <u>obvious</u> that you accept seductions and sexual activities.

                         Hanging out often with the adolescent in question, while building a solid friendship and close relationship over time, is a very good start and foundation to trigger a seduction upon.

                         <br />
                         
                         My personal favorite and best recommendation is to invite adolescents on weekend trips, and only the two of you, like a fishing or hunting trip. Find yourselves a nice and private camp site, and set up a tent that you'll <u>share</u>; and you will suddenly find yourselves in a very isolated, intimate and free setting outdoors, and in the wild, which usually increases the sexual drive of most human beings. And if the trip lasts for several days, the both of you will additionally build up sexual needs; making a sexual seduction even more likely to happen, especially from a young and horny adolescent boy.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It can also be a regular holiday trip to a cabin or hotel as well, which also lasts for several days. You may then rent a room instead, that has only <u>one</u> double bed that you'll need to share. Not as effective as a trip into the woods, but still very effective.

                         Though, trips like these are usually <u>reserved</u> for family members and close neighbors and friends. And close <u>family</u> is usually required for adult male and adolescent girl trips.

                         Do things for her, as in unloading her from physical work and tedious obligations; buy her some chocolate now and then.

                         Touch her in a loving way; the head and neck being especially sensitive. Like, pet and play with her hair some, and gently stroke her cheeks and neck with your fingers now and then; optionally while telling her how beautiful and special she is.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may also touch her arms, like stroking them for a few seconds up and down. But avoid touching her legs and thighs; especially avoid her chest, breasts and genital area.
                         
                         <br />

                         Hug her as well, and do that often, at least when you meet and say goodbye. By squeezing her some extra, you will really show and confirm to her her that you care for her (and want her). Optionally, combine the hugs with the previous touching.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you've got a close relationship, you may kiss her as well, but <u>not</u> on her lips. Kiss her forehead and cheeks instead. You may optimally kiss her neck and shoulders when hugging.

                         These tricks might not make her jump all over you in an instant; but they <u>will</u> build up romantic and sexual arousal within her, with time, which will motivate her to spend even more time with you and become even more close and physical, hopefully making her finally seduce you somehow.

                         While of course, your actions are fully decent and non-sexual; which actually is the best way to arouse females anyway, contrary to acting like a <u>sleaze</u> who serves her sexual compliments and touches her intimate parts without respect.

                         First of all, they <u>love</u> sex; it is as simple as that. So, it should be very easy to engage conversations about sex with them.

                         And the more you talk about sex, the more they will notice that you're interested in sex as well. So by time, they may become gradually more motivated to take things a step further.

                         If you manage to carefully move such conversations towards subjects like penis sizes and ejaculations, they may become motivated to compare your sizes or ejaculate together; or just see and explore a large adult penis, and see it ejaculate.

                         Accidentally leave porn magazines and movies around your home when they are visiting you. This should make them very motivated to watch them, and watch them together with <u>you</u>; movies usually being more effective than magazines.

                         Buy yourself some male sex toys, and show it to them for fun. You may of course engage a conversation about such toys first, and gradually tell them that you own a few. Maybe they'll want to see them? And, interesting things can happen!

                         With boys, it's all about talking about sex and trying to initiate related activities as often as possible. It's all about trying to turn them on and motivating them to suggest sexual activities.

                         And thus, you may just become <u>seduced</u>.

                         <span class="glow_orange">Generally spoken</span>, you may of course try inverting these advices; meaning that you may try the romance route with boys and sex talk and porn route with females.

                         But I <u>do</u> have to warn you that the latter may backfire, as these advices are initially made to best fit each gender. Thus, the boys may end up offended; especially if you're a guy yourself and they are heterosexuals. And the girls may end up disliking you and thinking that you're a sleazy creep.

                         The bottom line here is that <u>all</u> adolescents, girls as boys, are some truly puberty horny beasts who actually are much easier to trigger than many of you may initially think.

                         Just make some honest attempts, while crossing your fingers. And if it doesn't work at once, stay <u>patient</u> and keep on triggering <u>until</u> they seem offended or crept out by it.

                         <br />
                         
                         Just as with regular children in the latter chapter, suggesting sexual play to adolescents can be done in two major ways: either the easy or the hard way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Unfortunately for the hebephiles however, the easy way isn't exactly all that easy after all.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Adolescents understand so much more than children do; so no matter what you do to try camouflaging your real intentions, the average adolescent will quickly see through it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But the latter issue doesn't <u>have</u> to be all that bad. And I will explain why by beginning with the easy approach, while gradually moving towards the hard:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Suggesting sexual play to adolescents can be done indirectly. This means that you will suggest doing a certain activity, which isn't a sexual activity <u>initially</u>, but the adolescent <u>should</u> see through it and understand that it really is.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can be a neat way to go about this, as it will clearly show you if the adolescent in question <u>really</u> wants to do sexual activities with you. If it seems positive and engaged towards the idea, it can mean that it feels ready to have sex with you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A cool way to go about this, is to play undressing games; as in suggesting to play a certain game against each other, where there will be a final winner and looser, and the looser will have to undress <u>one</u> article of clothing. Then it is just a matter of repeating the game, and see who gets nude first. And it shouldn't really matter <u>who</u> gets nude first, as either will become quite exciting for the both of you. You may of course set a nudity threshold, like you won't go any further than the panties; but this will be all up to the two of you to decide before the game starts. If you do choose to set a threshold, that is fine, because this threshold can be moved towards nudity with time; eventually removed completely.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Poker games are very often used for such activities, but those can be difficult for the younger adolescents to play and understand. But there's a huge variety of both card and board games that can be used, ideally a game that is based on randomness <u>and</u> has quick rounds.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The easiest way is to just use a couple of dices, and the one who ends up with the smallest number looses; and will have to undress one article.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Another way, but way more direct, is to ask the adolescent if it wants to play around some in the bed with you; like suggesting the two of you to cuddle and tickle each other under the duvet; eventually suggest exploring each other if you successfully get the adolescent into bed with you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And then there's the fully direct approach, also referred to as the hard way, which is to simply suggest going to bed together and have sex together. If the adolescent is a 13 year old female, or older, you may suggest becoming her first lover, as in taking her virginity and turning her into a real woman.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, you don't have to suggest the latter with words; you may just start to touch and kiss the adolescent in a sexual way, though as carefully and respectfully as humanly possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As always, it's best to <u>only</u> suggest sexual play to adolescents whom you know well. And that you <u>already</u> got a close and comfortable relationship. If not, you'll most likely be rejected, and probably end up as a creep in her or his eyes.

                         With adolescents, it starts by exploring each other's bodies. This is a nice foreplay to any first-time sexual intercourse, <u>and</u> an easy start for the adolescent. Then we'll move towards the <u>adolescent</u>, and seduce her or him through touching and masturbation. Our goal here is to arouse the adolescent in a way that will make a first-time oral sexual intercourse more tempting and less repulsive, and motivate the adolescent to swallow your cum. This will <u>also</u> make a first-time vaginal or anal sexual intercourse less painful and more successful too.

                                   As you may have noticed, this adolescent chapter teaches first-time vaginal and anal intercourses <u>without</u> any advanced training in advance; because most adolescents do initially not need such training before either, when it's done correctly.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   However, if you <u>do</u> have the opportunity and time to practice penetration training with them, that would always be the most ideal thing to do, even though it isn't strictly needed.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I always recommend starting with the <u>first</u> two activities, in the <u>order</u> listed above, especially if this is the adolescent's very first sexual experience and intercourse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Only when the first two activities have been <u>successfully</u> completed, should you go for either of the last three.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You see, the most common mistake done by hebephiles, and all other males who want to seduce adolescents sexually, is that they just make a quick physical move and is about to go <u>all</u> over them and <u>straight</u> for their genitals at once; which usually makes most adolescents very tensioned and nervous, causing a greater risk of both rejections and rape.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, I recommend <u>against</u> starting at either of the last three, <u>especially</u> the last two, as foreplay with sexual arousal will make any sexual intercourse way more successful, and give the adolescent a way better first-time experience.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, <u>which</u> activity to start at <u>will</u> depend a lot on the adolescent: if it has become very aroused by <u>only</u> making out and touching each other outside your clothes, like in the backseat of your car, you may just go straight for one of the last three. The adolescent may even be sexually experienced in advance, which several of them actually are, making things go surprisingly quick, smooth and well for several of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         All these activities can be performed during just <u>one</u> session, as all adolescents should be able to handle that flawlessly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, there might be a few of them who are not yet ready for any <u>intercourses</u>, which makes it wise to be patient and sensitive towards their feelings, and wait until they feel fully ready for it; thus only practice the first two activities for now, both of which can become extremely hot and give you a hot and great ejaculation nevertheless.

                                   Make sure to have an all clean body, as <a class="set3" href="swk_prep.html#hygiene_practice" target="_blank">described</a> in the latter preparation chapter. An unclean body or mouth is usually considered as repulsive among most people, which may cause an activity to fail miserably <u>and</u> be hard to repeat.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   These activities don't need much of strict preparations in advance, since adolescents can handle these activities almost anywhere at anytime. But <u>if</u> you're able to prepare in advance, and create ideal circumstances, please do so:
                                                       
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   A nice bedroom with a nice bed is highly recommended, as this will make things very comfortable and convenient. At least, have a soft surface for the both of you to lie on.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Increase the temperature of the room to above average, because being less clothed and nude can become freezing, thus uncomfortable and annoying for the adolescent.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   Make sure your hands aren't cold nor dry. Warm them up and use some moisture cream if necessary.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   Have a bottle of sex lubricants nearby, like in the drawer of your nightstand, as this will help you penetrate an adolescent way easier in general, especially if you fail to arouse it.
                                                       
                                   <br />

                                   Have some new and fresh condoms nearby and ready.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Sex toys, vibrators especially, are usually very exciting toys for the adolescents, which will help you make them seriously horny, thus come harder and faster.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Keep an eye on the adolescent's behavior during these activities, and see if it ever gets uncomfortable, which makes it wise to tone things down a bit, or even stop completely.

                         <br />
                         
                         A good way to initiate a sexual activity or intercourse with an adolescent, is to start it all by exploring each other's bodies; which may be considered as the very first step and barrier to break when being sexually intimate for the very first time.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                                             
                         I know, it may sound childish; but even sexually experienced adults actually enjoy doing this during first-time sex, which is my professional advice to all sexually active human beings.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will feel safe, while being both exciting and arousing, making it a very good start for all new sexual relationships, especially with insecure and/or inexperienced minors.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Therefore, suggest this to your sweet and young adolescent when you feel that it is appropriate to do so:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "I would really like for us to undress each other and explore each other's bodies; maybe even touch each other some and be close to each other. Would you like to do that?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, if you're dealing with a same gender adolescent, especially a non-gay, you may want to rephrase it a little bit:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "I would really like for us to undress each other and explore each other's bodies; maybe even touch each other some. Would you like to do that?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If a same gender adolescent should in any way seem skeptical towards this suggestion, you may want to add:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "There's nothing wrong with two boys/girls fooling around some. That doesn't mean that there's something wrong with us, nor that we have anything to be ashamed of. It doesn't have to mean that we're gay either. It just means that we're exploring and enjoying our bodies, because it is so cool doing so."
                                   
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         By using suggestions like these, the adolescent will feel <u>very</u> comfortable and safe; thus way more likely agree to fool around with you, touching each other, and rubbing yourself towards each other in nude, so you can come all over that young and soft adolescent body through the friction alone.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the adolescent still seems unsure or unwilling to do this, you may suggest keeping your underwear on; which usually helps a lot, and will eventually lead to nudity anyway.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Whether you're lying down or sitting down, being in a bed or outdoors in God's nature, suggest undressing yourselves simultaneously. If the adolescent seems shy, just start by undressing your own upper body, and then see what happens.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just be patient, and take your time.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you've become all nude, or undressed yourself as much as the adolescent accepts undressing for now:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "I have a cool idea: you can touch me at whatever part of my body that you want to, and I will touch the same parts of yours."
                                   
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This suggestion, or game if you like, is a great way to make the adolescent feel safe, comfortable <u>and</u> like being in total control of the situation. It will also make the adolescent feel that you respect it's lacking experience and innocence, which will build important trust for the later and more vital activities.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, you're free to compliment it's body during this process; but it's usually best to do that with the girls only, as non-gay boys may look at that as gayish if you're a male.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just let the adolescent look at and feel you all over, and simply touch the adolescent at the exact same areas, and those only.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Don't worry about getting an erection. Neither worry about ejaculating while the adolescent is exploring your penis. Adolescents can handle such surprises without any problems, and will most likely experience it as something very interesting and positive. Though, some may not appreciate being spermed all over without any warnings, but I don't see why this should become a large problem nevertheless.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Getting an ejaculation during this foreplay may actually be a nice thing anyway, as it will calm you down a lot and make you handle the next activities with much greater control and care.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you're dealing with a female adolescent, you may finally suggest embracing each other and rubbing yourself towards each other, while hugging and kissing; which would be ideal to do in a nice and clean bed, underneath a puffy duvet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may of course suggest the latter activity to an adolescent male as well, but only if you're sure that he won't look at it as gross; especially when it comes to that kissing part.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then you may just fool around and roll around while being physically close, in all nude, which is a great thing to experience with such young and innocent human beings.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Remember to control your arousal, as in not getting too eager, aggressive or moaning. However much horny you get, just try to control your appearance as much as possible, especially if the young one seems quite shy and insecure.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         And this is actually all there is to it!

                         We're talking about <u>adolescents</u> here, so this is a <u>very</u> easy and straight forward activity to perform.

                         <br />
                         
                         The next step is to try arousing the adolescent sexually, and try preparing it for a vaginal or anal sexual intercourse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the adolescent is already aroused, we will simply make it even <u>more</u> aroused; almost until she or he goes crazy of pure arousal, which can easily happen with these hormone junkies, and thus make them willing to do <u>anything</u>, without any hesitations nor applying any sort of brakes on you.
                         
                         <br />

                         This activity is initially easy to practice, but there sure are a few things to remember and do right, including significant differences between the girls and the boys, all of which we will thoroughly go through in this section.
                         
                         <br />

                                   If the adolescent isn't already undressed, as in not having already practiced the first activity, I recommend that you start with the latter and first activity before performing this one.
                         
                                   <br />

                                   It is also important that the adolescent has already agreed to genital touching. If not, you may want to stop at this point, and aim for a second attempt another day and time.

                         <br />
                         
                         Have the adolescent lie down on its back, and tell that you would really like to make her or him feel very good all over its body; and finally ask if that's alright with her or him.

                         <span class="glow_magenta">With adolescent girls</span>, most would think that going straight for the genitals would be the most effective approach to make her aroused and horny, and ready for a vaginal intercourse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Actually, that is incorrect!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you <u>really</u> want an adolescent girl to become <u>really</u> sexually aroused, start out by touching and caressing all of her non-genital areas; and use a lot of time doing that while looking deeply into her eyes with a friendly look.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A recommended touching technique is to use one hand to caress her stomach, while using the other to tickle the backside of her neck. Then move the hand from her stomach and to the side of her upper body, while the hand is continuously in motion. In time, move up towards her breasts, which you gently touch, and then down to the stomach again. Let the stomach hand travel through this route several times while watching her reactions to what you're doing.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the girl seems to enjoy what you do, and gets pleased by it, move your hand down towards her legs. Concentrate your hand on her thighs; first on the top, then on the outer sides, and finally the inner thighs and up towards her vagina. But don't feel the vagina yet, just jump back to her stomach. And keep on repeating this second route for a little while longer.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This touching will <u>really</u> stimulate her in a <u>very</u> teasing way, and gradually make her <u>want</u> to be stimulated genitally.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as you feel the time is right to go for the genitals, make your stomach hand just glide slowly downwards and over her vagina, with a flat hand. Then take it up again and continue caressing her stomach. Wait a little while before you repeat this once again. And don't use your fingers yet while being over her vagina, just use a flat hand.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This touching makes most adolescent girls go <u>crazy</u> horny!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the girl still seems pleased about what you're doing, now is the time to have your main hand <u>staying</u> over her vagina, while your other hand switches regularly between caressing her stomach and breasts.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now is also the time to start using your fingers on her vagina; so gently push your ring finger into her vagina and in between its outer lips, but not yet <u>inside</u> her vagina. Just let the finger slide up and down into her crack, gently and slowly, and keep on doing this for a little while.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Finally, find her clitoris and start rubbing it; not too hard, but neither too loose. Rub it consistently, while your other hand is still moving all over her stomach and breasts, and just see what all this does to your young sweetie.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After a little while of masturbating her, you may <u>optionally</u> lick her vagina and give her some nice and decent oral sex:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just move yourself down to her feet and start by kissing and licking them, optionally start on her knees, and just <u>slowly</u> work your way upwards with a lively and active tongue.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Begin licking her inner thighs when you're getting close to her vagina; and try waiting as long as possible before you finally lay your whole mouth over that young and fresh vagina, and start licking it like you've never licked anything before.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may just lick the vagina all over the place, but stick mostly to her clit, and do not stick your tongue into it at this stage.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The young girl has hopefully become aroused by now. But, if it doesn't seem like so, try not worrying too much about it:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some girls just need more time, thus you may start all over and begin caressing her stomach again. After a couple of more complete rounds like these, most adolescent girls should become at least <u>some</u> aroused.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Several girls may actually be quite aroused, but won't be acting like porn stars. You should then see at least a blushed face and some increased breathing, along with a wet vagina.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A few adolescent girls won't become aroused by this, mostly due to being too nervous. But as long as you are very kind and gentle with them, and don't become pushy, they should still appreciate all this attention very much, which sometimes is enough for them to willingly jerk or blow you off.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you feel ready to make an attempt to enter her with your genital, and perform a fully sexual intercourse, which ideally would be at the point of when she seems to be pretty close to an orgasm, move your kissing up towards her stomach, nipples. shoulders, and finally her face and lips.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then suggest an intercourse, by whispering into her ear with a calm and warm voice:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And hopefully, you may move straight to one of the next activities with your sweet little youngster.

                         <span class="glow_blue">With adolescent boys</span>, doing the opposite of what you would do with a girl, will be the most correct and efficient method, as in going <u>straight</u> for their warm and horny genitals:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Start with caressing the adolescent's inner crotch with your fingers, on each side of its genitals, and do that for a while. Use both your hands if you like.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then start to gently massage the area between the scrotum and anus with your fingers, before working your way slowly up towards the root of the penis with your thumb and fingers, now massaging the penis as far down as possible. And stay at this area for a longer period, as that will feel very nice for the boy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Gently pull his foreskin all the way back, and use your index finger to circle around the base of the glans penis, also known as the corona. After a little while of such circling, move the finger to underneath the glans, and start massaging that area gently with a light finger pressure; as that is actually a powerful and tickling erogenous zone among most boys.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the penis has become erected during this fiddle, caress the shaft of the penis with the top side of your fingers, very gently and tickling, up and down.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may repeat this process several times if you want to, to further arouse the young boy, and make him hard as a brick.
                         
                         <br />

                         Just as with the girls, you may optionally give your young sweetie some nice and decent oral sex:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Start licking his penis from the bottom and up, very slowly, and repeat this a few times.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Make sure that the foreskin is pulled all the way back before you start using the tip of your tongue to gently lick and tease both his corona and that sensitive area underneath the glans; just as you recently did with your finger.

                         Finally, open your mouth and just let it embrace that stiff and juicy penis; and then just suck and lick it, and enjoy it with your mouth, in anyway you please.

                         It is generally pretty easy pleasing a male penis!

                         As soon as the boy starts to moan, or have a super hard cock that has began dripping of natural lube, it is time to suggest a sexual intercourse:

                         The boys will be very easy to convince doing any of these, especially when they are very hard and very horny.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Several reports from gay hebephiles out there has told me that most of their young boys have sucked them willingly, and even swallowed their cum without much of problems; as these young boys are some truly rough and crazy beings.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The strong horniness of these young boys will also much easier allow you to fuck them from behind, at least <u>try</u> it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is usually best that <u>you</u> ejaculates first, and afterwards you satisfy the adolescent into an ejaculation. This will give you much better control over the situation, and get a much more successful and happy ending. Because, as soon as the boy ejaculates, he will loose much of his sexual desire and motivation for starting <u>and</u> completing any intercourse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These boys can come super fast <u>regardless</u>, even at the very beginning of this activity. These young and horny cocks are almost like unstable hand grenades. So, be careful!
                         
                         <br />

                         Hopefully, you may now move to one of the next activities, and have an oral or anal sexual intercourse with your sweetie.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="glow_orange">Generally spoken</span>, and in case you shouldn't remember all this when it happens, these are the simple gender rules:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With the girls, you start with their bodies and end with their genitals, while doing things as slowly as possible.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         With the boys, you simply start with their genitals, while being as quick as possible, so they don't come too fast.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will build up a lot of horniness before proceeding to an intercourse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, you don't <u>have</u> to proceed to an intercourse with either gender if the adolescent isn't yet ready for that. You may just explore and touch each other, and be physically close and cuddling, in all nude, while the both of you get either one or several nice orgasms. And if necessary, just redo these soft activities until the day comes when the young sweetie feels ready to be penetrated by an adult male.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you're worried about that sleazy talk that I suggested, especially with the girls, I can tell you that the <u>right</u> kids will become additionally aroused by that; even that small town Christian girl with pigtails and a blue country dress.

                         <br />
                         
                         Just like the first two activities of this chapter, having an oral sexual intercourse with an adolescent is initially very easy and convenient, granted that she or he agrees to do it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, you do have two choices here: either just let the adolescent suck you, or suck each other simultaneously.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It is hard to recommend any over the other. The first option will let you <u>see</u> the adolescent take your penis into its mouth. You may brush your fingers through its hair and cuddle with its face while it licks and suck you with its wet and delicious mouth. The second option will give you the privilege of enjoying the adolescent's genitals in the same time as she or he enjoys yours, which can become pretty hot to experience as well; probably even hotter, but who am I to decide?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If I where you, I would probably have just let the adolescent suck me first, thus taken things a little bit easy. This would also have given me more control over a first-time intercourse.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Yet another choice that has to be made, is the choice between coming inside the adolescent's mouth, coming onto its face or body, or ejaculating <u>completely</u> away from it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Ejaculating <u>away</u> from its face and body is obviously the safest thing to do if you're unsure about this. Just take it out right before the sperm spits out, and spit it somewhere else. However, if the adolescent is <u>very</u> sexually aroused and engaged in this activity, and seems to enjoy sucking your penis enormously, it should be safe ejaculating into its mouth and just tell it to swallow it all while coming. Or, find a middle way, and thus ejaculate all over its face and hair, or chest.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It can become <u>very</u> hard to abort such a nice blowjob, and come outside the mouth instead of inside it; so hard that even if you decide dong it outside, right before you're about to ejaculate, you will most likely shot your cum <u>far</u> into that sweet mouth anyway. So, think thoroughly about this in advance.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, you may talk with the adolescent about this before the oral sex is about to happen. Whether it agrees to swallow all your cum, or is totally against it, you will either way know what to do and not. But having any serious talk while the both of you are such warm and horny, right before a blowjob, is also kind of hard, thus easily omitted.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Having an adolescent give you a blowjob isn't any rocket science. Just make sure that you take things very slow and easy with the little one; suggest that it can kiss it first, then lick it some, and finally try taking it inside its mouth.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Caress and tickle with its face and hair while it tries to suck an adult male for the very first time in her or his life.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Some adolescents are very skeptical and careful about it, while others do it the very first time as if they had an oral sex university grade. There are many factors that will decide how they suck you, but having them super horny right before they do it, will definitely motivate them to suck you pretty nicely.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Don't be pushy, and never try to oral rape them by controlling or holding their heads against their own will. Stay patient and loving; and you will sooner or later get that nice blowjob.

                         If you manage to make an adolescent enjoy giving you oral sex, I can promise you that lots of hot and wet oral fucking will wait for you in a long line into the unseeing future.

                         Braking a young female's virginity, while she lies there like a fragile little bird within your strong male arms, is one of the hottest things an adult male can ever experience; so soft and delicate, such tiny, while smelling so nice.
                         
                         <br />

                         Not only is it a unique experience for the adult, but also a very special experience for the young girl if she's into it. All her sexual instincts will fire through her body like blizzards in a heavy thunderstorm, having a large and strong male holding her tightly down, seemingly aroused and aggressive, and all ready to come inside her for the very first time, becoming her very first male, making her almost crave for being raped.

                         Yes, many forbidden elements of our primitive ancestors are still there within us, planted deeply into our genes, and won't be leaving us anytime soon. So, let us enjoy that!

                         When young girls enter puberty at the age of 11, they are <u>already</u> starting to think about their first sexual intercourse. They fantasize about it while lying in their beds, some trying to penetrate themselves with the handle of their hairbrushes, trying to imagine having a strong male over themselves who loves them and cares for them, and comes inside them for the very first time. This is a normal psychological and sexual development among all adolescent girls.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When the time finally comes, and they <u>do</u> have that strong and breathing male over themselves, all their fantasies will suddenly become a reality, which can become just as fearful as it can become arousing and wet.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Most 11 year olds will be able to handle an adult male without any training in advance, and without being physically harmed. The more aroused they are, the easier it becomes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most 13 year olds will be just as capable of fucking for the first time as any adult woman, making this age the recommended age for taking their virginity without training.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         If you still insist on popping an 11 year old, you <u>must</u> be prepared to use a lot of lube, having some difficulties coming inside her because of the tightness, and bear with some weeping and sniffing while gliding <u>slowly</u> inside her, bit by bit.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         But, even though a 11 year old girl should weep and sniff some during the start of the intercourse, she may still enjoy it, and even get a little orgasm after a while and when the penis begins to slide easier in and out of her. Please note that girls tend to cry very easily in general, and may even cry because of the sexual arousal, enjoyment and excitement they feel.

                         Just be as careful as possible with that fragile little bird of yours, and show her lots of love and care while entering her for the first time; and it <u>should</u> end with success.

                                   All females are anatomically different, which means that <u>some</u> females will have abnormally tight or abnormally wide vaginas.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   The same goes for penises, as they vary a lot in sizes as well.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   Thus, attempting to penetrate an abnormally tight girl with an abnormally large penis may cause both difficulties and pain during the first intercourse(s). This problem can sometimes even make it impossible to succeed.

                                   However, an abnormally wide girl combined with an abnormally small penis will, on another hand, make it surprisingly easy popping a little youngster successfully, even a tiny 11 year old.

                         <br />
                         
                         Have the youngster lie comfortably on her back while you gently get over her.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the girl does not seem particularly sexually aroused, especially if she seems a little bit tensioned or anxious:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Whisper into her ear and tell her to relax and not be afraid, because you will use a lot of lubricants and be very careful. Also tell her that she can stop whenever she wants to. Because, all this will make her emotions and vagina relax.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then tell her that she will <u>now</u> become a <u>woman</u> for real; as this will keep her motivated to <u>complete</u> the act, even if it becomes uncomfortable and painful.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, tell her that the first time <u>might</u> hurt some; but even though it hurts, no harm will be done to her, as this is normal for every young girl who does it for the very first time. And tell her that the pain will decrease while you're doing it, and will one day disappear all together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is the time to be as kind, gentle and loving as possible. Use a calm voice to reassure her and use your hands to caress her face and hair. Also kiss her face and neck gently.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, the latter talks aren't strictly necessary if the girl seems very sexually aroused, like breathing fast, having a blushed face, and is all ready for an intercourse after having already been masturbated and/or licked close to an orgasm. You may then just gently start with the intercourse right away:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Even though you both are wet and dripping, <u>still</u> add sex lube onto your penis/condom; and don't be afraid of overdoing it. Sex lubes won't vaporize and disappear as fast as your natural genital lubes does, and thus make your genitals <u>continuously</u> lubed while trying to penetrate; which can and should take a while. And of course, always use lubes that are recommended and appropriate for vaginal sex.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If her vagina is aroused, it will widen up and shape itself internally to receive an erected male. Thus the more aroused, the easier you will glide inside her. If she's fully aroused and relaxed, she shouldn't feel much of pain at all; and everything should go pretty much smoothly and quickly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, the youngest adolescents will of course be both tight and shallow in general, requiring more time and patience to successfully slide all the way inside and start fucking them.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If all this is hard to remember while lying over a precious young girl for the first time in your life, and about to become her first, just remember these two words: <b class="h">slow motion!</b>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When getting inside her for the first time, pretend that you're in a slow motion movie. Do it <u>very</u> slowly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as she starts to grunt or twitch on your way into her, and show apparent pain, stop the insertion and gently slide out of her again. Let her rest for a few seconds, while whispering into her ears how much you like her or love her, how well this goes, how good she is in bed, and giving her all the nice and <u>motivating</u> compliments you can come up with. Then make another attempt like this, but push her a little bit further; and continue repeating this process until you feel that you're all inside, as in meeting a natural resistance and end.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When being all the way inside her, just stay inside her for 30-60 seconds or so, while continuing to compliment her, before gently starting to pump her.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I <u>know</u> how tempted it can become to just start banging her hard, fast and deeply. But believe me, that's not a good idea if you ever want to <u>repeat</u> this heavenly experience with her.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Take a few seconds of break now and then while staying inside her and cuddling with her, as described in the second last paragraph, and then continue in the same slow pace.
                         
                         <br />

                         For many females, regardless of age, the intercourse <u>itself</u> is usually not enough to get an orgasm. Thus, you may want to try stimulating her clitoris <u>while</u> you're carefully fucking her, or advice <u>her</u> to do it, so she can experience a nice orgasm.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Keep on doing it slowly until you either come inside her or into the condom; the <u>latter</u> being highly recommended(!).
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you ejaculate inside her, try not to make the same mistake that too many men do with both children and adult females during their first run, which is suddenly hammering your cock into her during the ejaculation. This cock hammering is normal by the way, and a part of the male instinct to get the semen as far as possible into the vagina, to increase the chances of pregnancy. You will have to try controlling this instinct, which most experienced males are able to, when that wonderful ejaculation comes while being all inside that tight and wet hole of your beautiful young girl.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A good time to end the session for now, would be after you've ejaculated into her. But of course, if the girl wants more, and tell you that, you are free to take her for another round. And when using a condom, always change to a new and lubed one for each run; as hygiene practice is important for you both.

                         I've heard some crazy stores from males who've popped adolescents for the first time, adolescents who've become so horny that they've done it for like 4-6 times in a row. This might actually happen when you're dealing with young and crazy females in their super horny puberty. So, be prepared!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When you're <u>finally</u> done, I always recommend that you lie beside her and just cuddle with her, complimenting her about how nice it was, how good she was in bed, and etc. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It's important that she ends up with a <u>final</u> impression of you having done this for more important reasons than just emptying your balls; you also did it because she's attractive and you like and love her. This will make her love you even more, and motivate her to do it again, and again, and again ...

                         This really isn't as complicated as you may think. The vagina is <u>designed</u> by nature for sexual intercourses, thus first-time intercourses with average adolescents are usually problem-free and goes much smoother than most predict.
                         
                         <br />

                         If the adolescent is very young, physically immature, or not all that into it, this activity might become a challenging task with tightness and pain. But, as the old saying among pedos goes: <i>"With enough lube and patience, <u>anything</u> is possible!"</i>.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you manage to make the adolescent enjoy this, you will have yourself a pretty horny and sexually active sex partner for years to come. Thus, the best of luck to you all, my friends!

                         Anal sexual intercourses are pretty darn unique:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         First of all, the anal is an erogenous zone among both males and females. It is located so close to their genitals that it shares the same sexual stimuli nerves; while additionally being located close to their internal reproduction organs, which are pretty sensitive to physical stimuli. All this make it possible for both males and females to actually reach orgasms through anal sex <u>only</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Second, the anal is also a <u>very</u> tight canal to enter for a male genital, with quite strong rectal muscles that will squash and release the penis in wet, hard and wonderful ways, as the inserted ones regularly retracts their muscles during arousal reflexes, and orgasms especially.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, anal sex is a wonderful thing for both the inserted and the one inserting, while making it possible for young <u>males</u> to actually be penetrated and fucked, just like females.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Please note that anal sex is <u>not</u> exclusively limited to gay male relationships. It is actually a lot more common among heterosexual men than most think, especially among open and free minded male friends and unknowns who hook up to enjoy this wonderful thing. Many males are also inserting themselves anally with various sex toys during masturbation, something that almost <u>certainly</u> increases the orgasms and makes you ejaculate more and harder each time.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Even adult males and females in regular relationships enjoy anal sex as well, as the rectum will be much tighter than any vagina can ever become.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <u>And</u>, you can have as much anal sex as you want to with adolescent girls, <u>without</u> making them pregnant; which means not having to use condoms, so you can come far inside them while <u>really</u> feeling their tightness and wetness.

                         Whether you have a male or female relationship that has become sexual, now I will teach you how to get inside that tight rectum for the very first time:

                                   Unlike a vagina, the rectum isn't made for sexual intercourses, making it a lot more fragile than a vagina, and not capable of stretching like one. Thus, most first-time anal intercourses <u>are</u> painful at different degrees, and <u>may</u> additionally cause tearing and medical problems for the ones being inserted.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   I <u>do</u> recommend the anal training program for the adolescents, as described in the next chapter, before any full penetration with an adult penis; <u>especially</u> if the adolescent is younger than 13.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   However, anal training isn't as strictly needed for adolescents as it is with children, so we <u>can</u> make an exception here.

                         I always recommend that the adolescent lies comfortably on his back while facing <u>you</u> during the intercourse. It's important to have eye contact and be able to communicate together with both words and expressions during such a critical event.

                         Be calm and nice to him, and do whatever you can to make him feel relaxed; as psychological relaxation will relax the internal sphincter (rectum muscle) to some degree, making this session as little painful and challenging as possible.

                         Just tell him in a loving way to relax and not be afraid, because you will use a lot of lubricants and be very careful. Also tell him that he can stop whenever he wants to.

                         You may want to warn about and prepare him for the pain that most likely will come, and reassure him that the pain is a normal part of first-time anal sex. But don't focus too much on the pain subject, as that may make him more anxious and tightened up, making this event more painful and challenging.

                         Lubrication is the <u>most</u> important part of safe anal sex practice, as the rectum isn't made for sexual intercourses, thus it doesn't provide any natural lubrication, which is very important to avoid taring and prolapse.

                         Sex <u>oils</u> are recommended for the first intercourses, as oils are very slipper. So, oil your penis/condom, and don't be afraid of overdoing it; the more oil you add before starting and during the intercourse, the better it is. And of course, always use oils that are recommended and made for anal sex.

                         Before starting, it's always for the best to arouse the adolescent until the point of his penis (or her vagina) releases natural lube. The adolescent will then be quite sexually aroused, which will motivate him to get something large into his rectum <u>while</u> becoming more tolerant to pain.

                         For first-time anal intercourses, I always recommend starting out with a sex toy that's approximately half the size of your penis. This has to be lubricated with oils as well. Let it just tickle the anus a little bit first, and then push it gently inside him while fiddling some with his genital to keep him aroused.
                                             
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as you notice a painful expression on the adolescent, stop the penetration and let the sex toy slide out. Reinsert it and repeat the latter; it will finally go deeper inside him, increasingly easier and less painful by each go, until you can fully fuck him with the toy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         After that, do the exact same thing with your penis: push it gradually inside him until it seems painful, and let it slide out. Try pushing it a little bit further inside with each go, and it should finally glide all the way inside him, just like the sex toy.
                         
                         <br />

                         It usually goes fine the first inch or so, but then you'll meet the internal sphincter that will feel like a barrier for the both of you, and a painful barrier for the one being inserted. When this barrier is finally broken however, the sphincter should automatically relax some, and thus become less painful.

                         Everything has an end, and so does the butt. You will quickly notice that you've reached this end when you sense a physical resistance further inside. But this might not happen if your penis is short; no offense. This physical resistance is usually accompanied with some pain for the inserted.

                         The use of a sex toy <u>is</u> optional, but highly recommended to prepare his rectum for your penis. This is <u>utterly</u> important for the younger adolescents by the way.

                         Make sure that you ejaculate inside that tight rectum <u>before</u> the adolescent does. As soon as the adolescent ejaculates, the anal sex session will suddenly feel way more painful and generally uncomfortable for him, because he will then get a sudden loss of sexual desire and motivation.

                         Though, the anal sex <u>alone</u> may make the inserted one ejaculate, because the large penis of the adult will most likely massage the adolescent's prostate and other internal sex organs pretty decently when being deeply inside him.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Well, making the inserted one get an anal orgasm starts by getting as far inside him as possible, and then move your penis up and down by wiggling your hip, in the same time as staying far inside him. With some time and practice, this can make the both of you go insane of pure horniness. But this is usually recommenced after a few runs, as it can become extra painful during a first-time session.
                         
                         <br />

                         Some blood and small reduces of feces should be expected; especially some bleeding during the very first intercourse. Though, the rectum is very good at healing itself, so any such bleeding should quickly stop and shouldn't cause any concerns; especially not if you've been very careful and taken hygiene seriously. Or, this might not happen at all. But considering the possibility, and all the oils used, having a towel underneath his bum while doing all this is always wise.
