                         Secrecy practice is the first and most important measure you can take when practicing illegal child love. It will protect both yourself and your children from the society and its laws.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Secrecy practice can also be a nerve wreaking experience for a pedophile, especially for a newbie who is doing this for the very first time, as you more or less have to put your whole life into a child's hands and its capabilities to keep secrets.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And the more children you're practicing illegal child love with, the more this fear will be multiplied.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But secrecy practice can actually become very secure and less nerve wreaking if you do things correctly. It's not enough to just tell a child to keep a secret, you'll have to put a much more complex and sophisticated system into practice.

                         When a decent secrecy practice is in place, you will feel very confident that your secrets are safe, and that they will stick only between you and your tiny lovers.

                         As you may remember from the child development chapter, the age of the child is very important regarding its capabilities to understand and keep secrets:
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Babies are the absolutely safest children to practice sex with. As long as you don't get seen, and thus caught, while doing it, and don't leave apparent traces behind your sessions, it will simply not be detected, as in never ever.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This unique safety will more or less continue into toddlerhood and until the point of where the children begin to join sentences decently. This capability varies a lot of course; some children will speak well at the beginning of toddlerhood, while others won't do before they get towards the end of it.
                         
                         <br />

                         Practicing illegal child love with the mid to latter part of toddlerhood is generally considered as highly dangerous, in regards to the children revealing it afterwards somehow. Though, there <u>are</u> a few tricks that can be used to suppress this danger, which we will go through later in this chapter.

                         As soon as the children become preschoolers, about 4 years of age, secrecy can be safely practiced; reasonably safe at the beginning of the stage, and very safe towards its end.

                         Elementary school first graders are even safer than the preschoolers, while moving towards secrecy excellence as they approach the end of their childhood.

                         Adolescents don't actually need any thorough secrecy practice, as they should be considered as young adults. But of course, it never hurts mentioning it and emphasizing its importance; especially at the very beginning of their stage.

                         Secrecy pedagogy is all about the education of secrecy for children, by using special pedagogic methods based on a combination of child psychology and real life experiences from professional pedophiles.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                                                  
                         By practicing such pedagogy, you will first of all create a very solid and secure basis to build your secrecy upon when doing illegal activities with a child. But you will also, during this teaching, easily notice how much a child <u>really</u> understands and appreciates the <u>importance</u> of secrecy, making you much better able to see if it really is safe to establish a sexual relationship between the two of you in the first place.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Repetition is also a very important part of secrecy pedagogy, to remind the child about how important it is to keep certain things a secret, as in practicing this pedagogy regularly.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         For the younger children, like the 4 year olds, who are just beginning to understand secrecy, repetition becomes especially important, to make sure that the pedagogy <u>sticks</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Another important part of secrecy pedagogy is to make sure that the child gets a <u>positive</u> first-impression and relationship to secrecy from day one; like feeling it as exciting and fun, and feeling special because you share something that's intimate and important, together and just the two of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, secrecy pedagogy is something that we practice to make sure that children learn what secrets are, and how important they are, in the most positive and constructive way possible for the child.

                         <br />
                         
                         And of course, correct secrecy pedagogy is a major part of the secrecy practice in this chapter, which you will learn all about when we get to that section.

                         More intelligent children will understand secrecy much better at much younger ages, and generally understand how important it is to avoid social stigma, thus destruction of both themselves and yourself. They will give you a lot of comfort and many nights of deep and relaxing sleep.

                         Less intelligent children will have trouble understanding the importance of secrecy at most young ages, especially up to mid elementary school. They will require a more extensive secrecy pedagogy and training to become just initially safe for illegal child love practice; but will never become comfortably safe <u>until</u> they reach their adolescence.

                         Luckily, <u>my</u> secrecy pedagogy should give you a decent knowledge about their true understanding of secrecy during the pedagogy itself, and way before anything becomes illegal.

                         The longer you have known a child, like if you're a parent or a close relative, the more successful your secrecy becomes.
                                                  
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Close family sexual relationships are usually the relationships with the greatest secrecy success, as these children won't <u>only</u> trust the pedophile a lot, but <u>also</u> fear the potential negative reactions and social stigma from its other close relatives if any secrets get revealed.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as you practice sex with children whom you don't know that well, whom are outside your close family, secrecy becomes less successful according to real life experiences, and will rely much heavier on dependency and chemistry:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The more dependent a child is on you, the more likely it will keep all your secrets; because she or he will then be afraid of loosing your special friendship and relationship.
                                                  
                         <br />

                         Children will usually become very dependent on adults, even strangers, if they got some kind of personal problems, whether being bad parenting at home, bullying at school, or various other negative elements in their lives. If you then make sure that the child gets lots of attention and love, your relationship will become very tight and special, which will create a great foundation for longterm secrecy.

                         A great chemistry will further seal your secrecy practice with longterm success; as great chemistry will initially cause a child to like and respect you, thus be highly motivated to <u>keep</u> all those crucial secrets that you share together.

                         Avoid causing discomfort and pain as much as possible; unless the child is fully agreeing to it and insists that you continue, like when its super horny during penetration training and regular intercourses.

                         It is now time to begin learning the actual secrecy practice, as in how to make children successfully keep crucial secrets.

                         <br />

                         First I will teach you common secrecy pedagogy that is used on most children between the ages of 4 and 11.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Then I will teach you special techniques for toddlers and adolescents, as these children are considered as special in this regard, thus they require a different practice.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                                   Some toddlers at the end of their stage will be mature enough to handle <b class="h">common</b> secrecy pedagogy; just like some adolescents at the beginning of their stage will be immature enough to benefit more from that pedagogy as well.

                                   Therefore, feel free to try the common secrecy practice on both mature toddlers and immature adolescents.

                         Common secrecy practice can actually be done even if you don't have any real plans of seducing a particular child, as many pedophiles do this with children just for fun and experimentation, and to build up experience and confidence before they start practicing secrets for real.

                         We will now try teaching a child of yours what a secret really is, and establish a brand new secret between the two of you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, and as an important part of establishing secrets with children, we will first <u>test</u> the child to see how well it actually understands and really keeps secrets, <u>before</u> we establish any <u>real</u> secrets that are based on illegal child love.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It is therefore important that we now establish a new secret that will upset the child's guardians somehow if it gets revealed by the child. In this way, you will know for sure if the child really is capable of keeping secrets or not.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, this new and first secret won't be based on any illegal nor harmful stuff, just something that is controversial enough to make someone upset about what you've done, <u>without</u> jeopardizing your relationship with the child nor any custody rights you might have for her or him.

                         It will be <u>much</u> better to make someone upset and take some verbal beating, instead of going to prison as a child molester, if your child fails to keep secrets.

                         When you're about to introduce secrecy to a child for the first time, make sure that you are alone together during the whole session, and that the child feels safe and comfortable.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;                         
                         <br />

                         Don't become authoritative nor rigorous during the session, but still try to be serious about the matter.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         It is recommended to sit on the floor together, ideally inside a familiar room where the child feels safe and comfy within. Avoid using e.g. an office or a car, as those environments may become authoritative and gloomy.

                         We want to give the child a good first-impression of secrecy, to build the best foundation possible for a secret sexual relationship. Children who think secrets are fun and exciting, will be much better at keeping them contrary to children who look at secrecy as something scary and dangerous.

                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, since secrecy practice is as important as it is, you may want to warn the child about the negative consequences of revealing secrets. But that should be reserved for <u>later</u>, when the time finally comes to actually have sex together.

                         I prefer to start by simply asking the child in a kind way:

                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                    
                         And this is a great way to start. It is a very easy question for most children to understand, and it will quickly and initially show you how much the child really understands secrecy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Young children, like the preschoolers, will probably become very excited at once. They may even start to ramble on about everything they know about secrecy. Most preschoolers should know what secrecy is anyway, at least to some extent, depending on their age, maturity and intelligence.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Of course, the older children, like the mid to late elementary schoolers, will probably just roll their eyes and make you feel very stupid. But this is nothing to worry about, as it will only make them feel even more comfortable towards you, which will only be beneficial to <u>you</u> in the end.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Whatever response you get, I always recommend teaching the child what a secret really is, as explained below.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, I also recommend using a special illustration while explaining. This will make all children within this age range understand secrecy in the best way possible, while also being quite interesting to watch.
                         
                         <br />

                         The only two props needed for the illustration is: a little box that is non-transparent and has a lid that can be opened and closed, and a shiny little object that will fit inside the box.

                         You may want to repeat this at least once, especially with the preschoolers and the younger half of the elementary schoolers. The youngest kids will most likely want to see it again anyway, because it is <u>unusual</u>, and thus exciting.

                         And this is actually all there is to the first step, which is all about educating the children about what a secret really is, while making it an exciting and positive experience.

                         This is when the real fun and excitement begin, as we will now actually establish a new secret with the child for the first time, and see if that child can keep that secret or not.
                                                  
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         This step can and should be executed right after the latter, as in doing them both in one single session.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         We will continue making sure that the child gets a positive relationship to secrecy, by making your very first secret both exciting and beneficial to the child.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Just as importantly, we will now actually teach the child in <u>practice</u> why special secrets must be kept, in the same time as the secret being harmless and fun.

                         You will now be laying the <u>very</u> foundation of all future and intimate secrets with this child of yours.

                         For this very first secret and important test, most professional pedophiles prefer to use the swiss army knife for pedophiles: <b class="h">carbohydrates</b>. In other words, candy, cookies or anything sweet with lots of sugar in and on it.

                         If you really want to go to town with this first secret, make sure to use a large and delicious cake, ideally professionally ordered and made at a bakery, like a very fat and creamy cake with lots of sparkling colors on it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Not only will the kid enter sugar Heaven, but you will peak into one yourself, by watching those creamy slices enter that wet and sexy mouth at closeup; a mouth that you will hopefully get closer to, or even enter yourself, one day in the future.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Well, an ordinary little bag of candy or jelly beans works too. But the more extraordinary the treat, the more <u>efficient</u> and <u>reliable</u> this first test becomes.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Present the cake (or candy) to the child, and ask if she or he would like to have some; ideally when candy is <u>not</u> allowed to be consumed, like outside weekends and special occasions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Even how little likely it is, there is this slim possibility that the child don't want any. This would be super rare, and it would most likely be an important warning sign of either the child being sick or it don't feel comfortable around you at all. Unless the child is sick, I would have taken it as a <u>very</u> bad sign in general, and thus chosen <u>another</u> kid for seduction.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The child will most likely drool and lick its lips all around while nodding quickly.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         But of course, you will now have to tell the child that it can only have this treat on one important condition, which is that it cannot tell about this to anyone. It will have to be a special secret between only the two of you. And it has to be a secret because other adults say we can't eat such nice things whenever we want to.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As you may have noticed, we are not really threatening the child about other adults becoming upset if they find out about it. We only <u>imply</u> that it is <u>forbidden</u>, and that <u>this</u> is the reason for keeping it a secret.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If the child agrees to this condition, which is very likely to happen, give the cake (or candy) to the child and watch all of it go into that sweet little mouth. And make sure that you eat along with the child, so this becomes a special experience that you together <u>share</u> in secrecy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Don't let it eat too much cake; you don't want to end up with a sick child that vomits all over your nice carpet. And that wouldn't have been a nice start for your secrecy pedagogy!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         And this is actually all there is to this second step.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         The child will now look at secrecy as something very exciting and fun, and associate it with delicious and beneficial stuff, as well as in <u>practice</u> learn why it's important for secrets to be kept and treasured in the first place.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may add a glass of soft drink as well, like Coca Cola.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         At the very end, you may want to remind the child about this having to be a secret. And once again, avoid using threats or associate secrecy with something negative. Keep your focus on positive elements only, during this early stage.

                         Some professional pedophiles want to be <u>really</u> sure that the child is capable of keeping secrets, so they move this test a few notches up; a lot of notches actually.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You will use the same procedure as with the cake (or candy), but instead of using carbohydrates, you will use cigarettes and champagne instead.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Explain to the child that there are certain adult things that children aren't allowed to do, which includes smoking and adult drinks. Then offer the child the unique possibility to try both of these things out, if it promises to keep that a secret.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is usually done with the older children of this age stage, like the 8-10 year olds. But, you could always try it out on the younger ones as well.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of <u>course</u>, regarding the cigarette, you won't be igniting it. <u>And</u> regarding the champagne, you will only give the child alcohol-free champagne. So yes, I'm still okay.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You don't want the child to begin coughing and vomiting from inhaling an ignited cigarette, and/or end up drunk with alcohol poisoning. That wouldn't have been any nice secret to keep!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Let the child play with a non-ignited cigarette, and breathe it in if it wants to. A cigarette is harmless for children to breathe in for short periods while not being ignited.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then give the child some bubbling water. And you can give the child as many drinks as it wants to, since it's alcohol-free. (But the child won't know that it is alcohol-free!)
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Just let it taste and experiment with these forbidden stuffs.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         For the child, it isn't the tastes that are important. The important thing is to do something that it <u>knows</u> is totally forbidden; it will make it feel <u>special</u> and like <u>big</u> girl or boy.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Though, I cannot leave this section without warning you:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If any of the child's guardians finds out about this, as in the secret becoming revealed by the child, you might end up in a quite unfortunate situation. You will then have some <u>explaining</u> to do, unless you decide to call the child a liar.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A 'good' explanation for this would be to say that you just wanted to satisfy the child's <u>curiosity</u>, and not make those things so forbidden that the child would want to try them out by itself later in life within uncontrolled environments and without an adult present to protect and supervise. This is just <u>your</u> way of protecting children from adult temptations.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And of course, explain that the cigarette was never lit and the champagne didn't contain any alcohol. You can even show the concerned adult the bottle the child drank from; which will keep you safe legally wise.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But, it might still cause negative social consequences, like earning yourself a bad reputation as a guardian, and even risk loosing your legal rights to be alone with that child.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But then again, however bad this hardcore secrecy may end, it will always end <u>far</u> better than actually being caught for sexual activities with the child, or premature rape. And this is why some pedophiles choose this hardcore way of secrecy pedagogy; if the child can safely keep <u>those</u> secrets, it will most likely keep <u>any</u> secret into the unseeing future.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The last step is very easy, and all about confirmation.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This step should be done at least 24 hours after step 2, as in a day or so. Ideally, you should wait a whole week if possible. But no longer than a week is required.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If you hear nothing during the first week, the secret should be safe. Because, if the child had spoke about eating a delicious cake in the middle of the week, most parents would at least have approached you with their <u>curiosity</u>. You would definitely had heard from them if their child had spoke about smoking cigarettes and drinking champagne with you!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         During this session, we will simply check if the child remembers what you taught it the last time you spoke about secrecy, <u>and</u> if it has safely kept your very first secret.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Contrary to the first step, ask these questions spontaneously while you're doing something ordinary together, like building Lego or playing football. But as always, avoid being authoritative. This will create a great environment for honesty.
                         
                         &#160;

                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Do you remember what I said about secrecy last week?"
                         
                              </div>

                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If the child only says yes or nods, you can additionally ask the child if it can explain what a secret is.

                         The child doesn't have to remember everything correctly, as in word by word, but <u>should</u> emphasize what secrecy is all about; then you'll know for sure that it really understands it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If the child doesn't remember anything you said about secrecy, or seems very unsure about secrecy in general, the child may either be too young or lack the basic required intellect to fully understand it.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         And then comes the second important question:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Have you told anyone that we [eat cake / smoked cigarettes and drank adult drinks] together last week?"
                         
                              </div>
                         
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Ideally, the child should tell you that it has kept your secret and not told it to anyone. And even more ideally, tell this in a happy and ensuring way.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It may even ask if you can do all that again soon, which you <u>should</u> do, to further test its secrecy capabilities and continue stimulating its needs for doing bad and secret stuff.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the child doesn't ask, you may instead and optionally ask if it would like to do all that again.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         With most preschoolers, and elementary schoolers especially, this should work out very well and give you the confirmation and insurance that you want and need to safely engage a sexual relationship with the sweetie.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         If this doesn't work out that well, like if the child fails to remember and understand what secrecy is, or have failed to keep your secret, the first and most logical thing to do would be to repeat this process all over to see if that helps any.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But the best thing to do if this fails completely, would be to seriously think about finding yourself another child love candidate. Or at least, wait a year or so to see if the child needs more development to handle secrecy as it should.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         This process is all about education and confirmation of a child's ability to keep secrets. You will have to make your own judgment if this child will be capable of keeping your critical future secrets about child love practice, or not. These sessions should nevertheless give you a very nice and clear indication about its secrecy abilities, while being easy to do.

                         For the utter ends of childhood, which in this regard means toddlers and adolescents, <b class="h">common</b> secrecy pedagogy becomes less efficient because of the following reasons:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         Toddlers aren't capable of understanding secrecy at all, in the same time as being very chatty from mid toddlerhood an on, making secrecy pedagogy very little efficient and very dangerous to relay on when making love to these little dolls.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />

                         Adolescents are actually mature enough to fully understand secrecy, without having to learn anything about it, which is obvious for their age and very nice when you think about it. So, secrecy pedagogy becomes less efficient; but that doesn't mean that secrecy <u>practice</u> should be all omitted.

                         Since <u>infants</u> are too young and immature to reveal sexual play all by themselves, they are irrelevant in this regard.

                         So, for toddlers and adolescents, I will now present some <b class="h">special</b> tricks and tips to help you decrease the chances of these children telling about your illegal interactions:

                         Most children enter a dangerous epoch at approximately 2 years of age. This epoch can last a couple of years and is the epoch when they aren't capable of understanding the <u>importance</u> of secrecy. In the same time, they are quite chatty while becoming increasingly better at joining words into sentences and generally expressing themselves to others.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         They love to tell others about what they've done and are about to do, and they talk a lot to themselves during play, all of which can potentially contain crucial information.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         So, when you're about to practice illegal child love with these little dolls, there will always be a risk of having this practice revealed through a toddler's everyday chat and expressions.

                         <br />

                         Not all toddlers are alike though. Some are very chatty even at the earliest stage of toddlerhood, while others are very quiet all the way through it. Some speak intelligibly and are good at expressing themselves and explaining things, while others just babble nonsense mostly. Some are attentive to details, while others are not. And the list goes on.

                         So, what do toddlers talk about on an everyday basis?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Their language is usually quite presently based. They babble a lot, but they usually babble about the things they're currently doing, especially play related. They also babble in an attempt to communicate their current needs to a carer, like saying they're thirsty, hungry or need to go to the bathroom (during potty training).
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Most toddlers talk thus less about past and future occasions. But when they <u>do</u> make that decision, as in telling about something that has recently happened or is about to happen, they usually do so because those occasions are <u>extraordinary</u> and especially meaningful to them; thus being usually about either very positive or very negative things:

                         Those are some common sentences from an average 2.5 year old that are especially meaningful to her or him.

                         It is also worth mentioning that some adults may <u>ask</u> their toddlers about what they have done today, which very much triggers past occasion sentences from toddlers:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adversary">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "What have you and uncle Joe been doing today?"

                         </div>

                         So, if you sexually seduced that toddler for the very first time that day, the toddler will most likely look at it as extraordinary; thus a quite unfortunate answer <u>may</u> come out of it:

                         When possible, the best tip of them all is to <u>start</u> your illegal interactions with children during their infancy. Let them regularly see and play with your penis, and generally become familiar with erections and ejaculations. Your sexual activities will then <u>not</u> become extraordinary during their toddlerhood, thus they will less likely tell or babble about it in general.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Look at this as building a nice security foundation for the dangerous toddlerhood, which should be done <u>regardless</u> when possible, even though if you're not into infants.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Intimate care and washing is a regular part of a toddler's life, which involves regular exposures and touchings of their genitals. Such care can be <u>combined</u> with sexual activities if being careful and incremental. The toddler will then learn that this is a normal routine, and a delicious part of intimate care, thus nothing extraordinary to tell or babble about.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also talk a lot with the toddler when having sex together, about things not related to the things you're doing. Give the child a new toy to look at while fiddling with it or rubbing your penis towards its genitals and bum. Do this to distract and confuse the toddler, and make it hard for the child to register what really happens, as these children aren't especially good at registering multiple things at once.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, the mentioned tricks have a couple of drawbacks:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As already stated, toddlers do talk a lot about everyday stuff during play, whether they play alone or with other children. So even though you make sexual activities into regular activities with a toddler, it may still talk about it during day-to-day play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Toddlers are also, during their play, imitating adults and things they have learned. They may e.g. start touching and sucking on doll genitals, something that is otherwise abnormal for a toddler to do, which obviously can reveal 'sexual abuse' if there are any observant or trained carers around to see that.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And, if you distract a toddler during sex, you will loose that important sexual connection and communication between the two of you during the sex, while the the toddler may not react to any sexual stimuli, which is a big loss in my opinion; there's nothing like looking straight into each others eyes while enjoying sex together, and seeing the little tot breathe and enjoy it, and finally come with twitches and shivers.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you aren't able to practice sex with a child all the way from its infancy, neither want to use intimate care nor any distractions during sex, <b class="h">object renaming</b> is a very effective way to have safe sex with toddlers:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This trick is all about polluting a toddlers vocabulary with nonsense during sexual activities. So, if the toddler feels like telling or babbling about those activities later, it will more likely express this pollution instead of anything meaningful.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         For starters, call your genitals something <u>special</u>, as in never using any regular names like penis, vagina, pee-pee and etc.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />

                         You should call it something ridiculous; so if the toddler talks about it later, it will simply be passed by as everyday toddler jargon among other adults.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may call your penis <span class="green"><b>Laa-Laa</b></span>, which is a popular television show figure among toddlers. So, if a toddler sees or plays with your penis, and decides to tell or babble about it later, it will more likely talk about this Laa-Laa figure instead.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And you should do the same thing with your semen, if you ever plan to ejaculate either in front of or onto the toddler, which you may call <span class="green"><b>joy</b></span>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Suddenly, things become a lot more secure, as you can see, just by using a simple trick like this. Because, most people won't care all that much about it if a toddler talks about Laa-Laa and all the joy that comes out of it, or babbles about this during general play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Please note that it is <u>very</u> important to <u>not</u> use possessive pronouns like 'my' or 'daddys'. Don't say 'my Laa-Laa' or 'daddys Laa-Laa', Just say 'Laa-Laa'.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, most 3 year olds are old enough to <u>add</u> possessive pronouns, even switch Laa-Laa with pee-pee, all by themselves; especially the smarter ones; which is exactly why 3 year olds are marked as dangerous. But, it may still work perfectly well, as I've heard of several successful instances. Carefulness is nevertheless very important in this regard.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may want to add complete sentences as well, as the toddlers will most likely use those sentences as a basis when telling or babbling about what you've done:
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                    
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Do you want to play with Laa-Laa?"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                    
                         This would be a great sentence to use when introducing your penis to a toddler for the first time.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Also note that you should <u>always</u> use the word 'play' instead of 'touch' and 'suck' when interacting sexually with toddlers.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And when you ejaculate all over that cute little tottie:
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <div class="quote_adult">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Look! It comes joy out of Laa-Laa!"
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                    
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may of course switch these names into anything you like, it doesn't have to be 'Laa-Laa' or 'joy'. But it <u>should</u> be silly names that fits together in a silly way, like my samples do, which will pass by most adults if being heard.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         In many occasions where toddlers actually <u>do</u> reveal crucial things, many adults actually switch to 'denial mode', thus more or less ignore it. Some may even become angry at a toddler and give her or him a slap. This is a quite common phenomena within human psychology, and something that I will go deeper into in the upcoming <b class="h">Getting Caught</b> chapter.

                         Well, as you now can see, toddlers are some dangerous creatures to fiddle with sexually while they're all awake and conscious about what's happening.

                         But as you also can see, there <u>are</u> some tricks that you can use, which are especially effective on the 2 year olds, but just partially effective on the more developed 3 year olds.
                         
                         <br />

                         And this leaves us to the last and best tips for toddler sex: have sex with them while they're in deep sleep, especially the 3 year olds and those who have good speech. Then they won't register anything that happens, while most toddlers sleep very deeply anyway.

                         One very nice thing about adolescents, is their great initial capability to keep secrets. You don't really need to specify it in any way, as they already know it and thus shouldn't tell.
