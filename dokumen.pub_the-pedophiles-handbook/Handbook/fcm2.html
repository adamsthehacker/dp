                         It's not that hard, nor is it rocket science, turning an average community lot into a kiddie magnet. Most communities have lots of children within, who will always be playful and curious, and be all over the place, so attracting them is basically easy.

                         I will start with the least expensive and resource demanding project, and gradually move towards the opposite.

                         The funny thing about these instructions, is that the least expensive ones might just be the most effective ones. Though, this will depend some on the actual location and the wealth of your community.

                         Most kids at almost all ages, especially girls, adore animals. But they have one huge problem: their parents or guardians usually don't allow them to own any, especially not the most exciting animals out there. And that is an advantage for <u>us</u>.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         So, if you have an animal farm at your lot, ideally with some exciting animals, the kids will be naturally drawn towards it, just like a real magnet pulling metal towards itself.

                         Animals come cheap. There are lots of animal shelters out there with animals that can be obtained for free, especially loose dogs and cats that have been picked up by the police. There are also various animal owners out there who give away free puppies and kittens too.

                         <br />
                         
                         But animals are generally not that expensive to buy actually, so visiting an animal shop to buy some smaller and unique creatures should not become all that pricey.

                         The more unique your animals are, the more powerful this kiddie magnet becomes. But just one dog, especially a puppy dog, can actually do the trick all by itself.
                         
                         <br />

                         The most important thing with animals however, is the bonding effect:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Children just <u>love</u> to see cute little animals grow and develop, and be an intimate part of that. But even fully grown animals will still have a pretty good bonding effect on many children. 
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         E.g, a little girl can too easily create very strong bonds with an animal, and almost feel like it is just as much hers as it is yours, something that you actually <u>do</u> want to happen. She can very easily become more attached to this animal than her actual best human friends. Most animals are capable of creating very strong bonds and dependencies with children.

                         The least expensive and outrageous animal to obtain and install into a community lot, would be a simple and honest puppy dog. This may not qualify your lot to become a <u>farm</u>, but it sure is a good start.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It's very important that it is a puppy, and not a young or fully grown dog. It should ideally come almost straight from birth, as that will make it very special and super attractive.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Because, puppies are special; first of all because of their cuteness, but also because they will grow up and thus have an enormous bonding effect on most children (girls).
                         
                         <br />

                         Puppies can be safely walked around in any neighborhood to <u>advertise</u> them to the neighborhood children, so they will learn that you got a puppy on your lot, with very little danger of raising suspicions and revealing your true intentions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I always recommend obtaining 2 puppies at once, to make your lot <u>highly</u> special, thus <u>very</u> attractive.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         As soon as the puppies become puppies-no-more, and the children loose their interest for them, they're just as easy to get rid of as they where to obtain. And this cycle can repeat itself with new puppies and new children, with hopefully an endless traffic of kiddie sex toys to your property.

                         The next on the list are rabbits. These 'guys' are initially way more exotic than puppy dogs, and will have the same effect on children regarding bonding and dependence.

                         Rabbits have a tendency to attract small children, especially 3-5 year olds. Even barely walking toddlers want a piece of the rabbits, though usually companied by a parent, but not always; as 5 minutes with a toddler is all you need.

                         <br />
                         
                         What makes rabbits a second option, is because they're not that easy to advertise. Puppy dogs can be walked for decent distances, which is important to advertise them to the neighborhood kids. And walking a puppy dog is rarely looked at as any unusual. However, walking around with a laced rabbit in a neighborhood, especially as an adult male, will make it far more apparent as a kiddie magnet for pedophiles. And this limitation make rabbits more locally bound, as they should only be advertised within the borders and fences of your own property, causing a potential reduction of visitors.

                         But if you <u>do</u> get kids to your lot with the help of a rabbit, they will definitely come to stay.

                         <br />
                         
                         And never underestimate the power of <u>rumors</u> among community children; if just one kid learns about your rabbit, be sure that more will learn about it during near future.

                         Rabbits are convenient to own in several ways, as they are basically very stationary and easily maintainable, thus they don't require that much of work to own. They can stay outside most parts of the year if they have a proper shelter, thus function as a continuous outdoors magnet that can attract random children 24/7 all year long, if the cage can be easily seen from outside your lot. And of course, owning more than just one rabbit will amplify the magnet.

                         The great thing about rabbits, is that they may even become almost totally maintenance free. Because, most little girls would be <u>very</u> happy to do all the maintenance work <u>for</u> you(!). Not only will they jerk you off in your favorite chair, but also take care of your animals. And that is just so dang neat.

                         The last group of animals among the top three, are kittens.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Kittens are very small, very cute, and they're very active and fun playing with, which makes them a great kiddie magnet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The reason for the kittens ending up at third place, is mainly because they're not as popular among children as the other two. Cats are the most common household animals, and many families already have one. This is also the first animal most children are allowed to own, because cats are so independent, easy to maintain, and cheap to keep healthy. 
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         By being such independent as cats really are, they tend to create lesser bonds with kids too, and humans in general. You just don't feel that dependence and bonding with a cat, like you do with puppy dogs and rabbits.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         They're also kind of hard to advertise, just like the rabbits are, because it will look quite unusual for a male to play with a kitten around in the neighborhood all by himself. This can quickly seem like an obvious kiddie magnet, though probably not as obvious as with rabbits.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But they're still decent magnets, especially among children who yet don't have nor own any animals yet.
                         
                         <br />

                         They're easy to get, usually free of charge, very independent and maintenance free, and generally cheap to run. In other words, a nice kiddie magnet investment for all pedophiles, which potentially can give lots in return.

                         The more special and uncommon your animals are, the more attractive and visited your lot will become.
                         
                         <br />

                         A baby pig, lamb, or pony, will make your lot stick out in ways that are simply impossible to accomplish with standard household animals.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, one big downside of having uncommon animals on your lot, is that it won't only draw the kids attention to your lot, but also your neighbors in general.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Like, if you live in a traditional community neighborhood and have a pig in your garden, your neighbors may look at you as a very weird person, which in the end may give you a negative reputation among your neighbors. Even the kids may think that you're weird, which actually may create the opposite effect of what we're trying to accomplish.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And why do an adult and single male buy himself a pony in his garden? Most likely to attract children; and there we suddenly have an obvious kiddie magnet again.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Special animals can become some <u>really</u> powerful magnets. But, they can sometimes become so powerful that they also become a challenge to handle properly as kiddie magnets, especially if you're inexperienced within this field.

                         <br />
                         
                         Thus, you must be <u>careful</u> about what sort of special animals you install into your property, and how you present them, while considering where you actually <u>live</u> and how acceptant your neighbors are.
                         
                         <br />

                         You must also check your local zoning laws, as some areas simply won't allow you to own certain special animals.

                         Special animals do usually have special needs as well, which may require a lot of tedious work and responsibilities.

                         There are lots of indoor animals that you can acquire, like rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chinchillas, squirrels, or creepy but otherwise harmless spiders and reptiles. Some of these can be very exotic too, many of which most children have never even seen before in their lives. PS! Spiders and reptiles are <u>especially</u> popular among little boys.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         How about exotic birds and speaking parrots? Or if you got some cash, what about a large aquarium with exotic fishes and water creatures?
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, the list is long; so I recommend that you do your own research on both legal and illegal exotic animals.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Unlike special animals, you can have whatever indoor animal you want to, and as many as you want to; because they will be <u>inside</u> your home and not visible to your neighbors, thus avoiding becoming the neighborhood oddity.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But of course, if your neighbors aren't able to see them, then the children won't see them either; thus why this group of animals is my last recommendation of the top 5.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         There are basically two ways to advertise indoor animals:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Talk about your animals to the closest kids in your neighborhood. Optimally, talk to their parents first, and hope that they will tell their children about it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Use any other outdoors kiddie magnet mentioned in this chapter, to more easily get the children to your property <u>before</u> inviting them inside to see you indoor animals.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Unique indoor animals may be something that you want to consider acquiring <u>regardless</u>, as they will <u>very</u> easily get children inside your home; which will create more trust, friendships and intimacy with time, so the children can bond just as much with you as they will bond with your animals.

                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you live somewhere outside but still somehow close to a traditional community neighborhood, or you're able to buy yourself some land not that far away, creating a <u>real</u> animal farm would be a really good idea to attract lots of children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now you can invest in almost all sorts of animals without offending any close neighbors nor ranking down your own reputation, optionally make it into a free and family friendly arena for everyone to freely visit, so it almost becomes a little fun park for children. And of course, create an arena that <u>really</u> welcomes children to visit <u>anytime</u> they want to, and all by their own, like on the way to or from school, making your lot a strongly amplified and continuous kiddie magnet with all sorts of children almost continuously hanging out there.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         I actually know about one person who started such a project, who ended up with a large pedophile heaven, and have been enjoying sex with children for more than 10 years.
                                                                           
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, creating such a farm can potentially cost a lot of money and require significant resources to maintain and keep legal. But it really doesn't have to become all that expensive nor that resource hungry with some creativity and easily maintainable animals. But of course, it will nevertheless require some basic knowledge about animal keeping.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         A nice thing about an animal farm is that all the children who want to, can help you run and maintain it, as most would love to do that for free, just to spend time with and bond with various animals. That would be a very nice and efficient way to make lots of new and small friends; eventually lovers.

                         <u>Money</u> will very much attract most children at almost all ages; because most kids don't have a regular income except for a small weekly fee that they get from their parents, which really isn't enough to buy them all the nice things they both want and need. But there's something that's even <u>more</u> attractive than money, and that is <u>easy</u> money. And the latter can become an extremely powerful magnet that can develop into many different and interesting situations for pedophiles.
                         
                         <br />

                         This method can actually be combined with the Animal Farm project in two ways: you may use this method to <u>announce</u> your farm, or you can use it to <u>keep</u> certain children at your farm once they arrive. And you can do all this by suggesting help for animal care, which will pay money in return.

                         <br />
                         
                         The basic idea with this magnet is to announce that you need help to either care for animals or perform easy and childproof work tasks related to your garden and home.
                         
                         <br />

                         And this has to be announced locally, with <u>care</u> in mind.

                         Since children at almost all ages love animals, if they learn that you need help to care for your animals, they will come. They will <u>especially</u> come if they get <u>paid</u> for doing something that they really enjoy doing, while also being easy work.
                         
                         <br />

                         The most usual and popular animal care work among children, is walking dogs. And of course, get yourself a little dog that can be easily walked by young children.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Dog walking won't get the children indoors at once, but it <u>is</u> a very nice place to start at to build basic trust and friendships, which <u>eventually</u> will get them inside. It's also the least suspicious magnet to advertise in your local community, as many people and families are already doing it as we speak.

                         It can also work as a nice introduction point for <u>other</u> jobs and magnets mentioned in this chapter.

                         Cleaning rabbit, hamster or bird cages, which ideally should be clean in advance so it becomes more attractive, which includes handling the animals, are also popular jobs. And of course, feeding the animals by refilling water and food.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These latter tasks will much easier get the children indoors, but they will <u>also</u> be more suspicious to advertise.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Another really attractive job would be to just socialize and play with the animals, so they don't get lonely. But this will be the most suspicious task and work of them all to advertise, simply because it becomes a little bit <u>too</u> convenient and easy.

                         There are lots of general tasks on an average property that can be safely performed by most children, which they will enjoy doing for money.

                         Watering your lawn and flowers are definitely the easiest and most popular work tasks that children can perform at almost all ages. As long as the garden hose is all ready, and long enough to get around, the kids can just quickly and safely go about these task.
                         
                         <br />

                         You may eventually invite them inside your home to help you water your <u>indoor</u> plants as well, but only if the children aren't accompanied by any adults.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Picking weed in your garden is also a very easy and generally nice work task for most children to perform.
                         
                         <br />

                         Planting flowers is also very popular, not to mention fun, especially among little girls. Just do all the preparations in advance, so they just need to place the flowers into the ground or into pots, and then just pad soil around them.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, flower planting is kind of a suspicious work task to advertise among children. But it sure is a great addition to the much less suspicious watering and weed picking jobs, especially if you want them to stick around for a longer period.
                         
                         <br />

                         Cutting the lawn at summertimes, and shoveling snow at wintertimes, are two great and very little suspicious work tasks for the older children; especially if you want to attract young boys. Anything that requires some use of cool tools and equipment will further attract <u>boys</u> especially.

                         <br />
                         
                         But always be careful when letting children handle tools that can potentially harm them if not being handled right. Make sure to <u>thoroughly</u> teach them how to use them in advance.
                         
                         <br />

                         Painting is also a great way to attract the older children, which can also be done indoors, at least eventually. Such jobs can also attract the younger children, as long as you can live with paint being spilled all over.

                         There are lots of general tasks to be done both outside and inside your home. It's usually best to first start with outside jobs, and slowly move the children to inside jobs as you build trust and confidence with time; unless you know them well.
                         
                         <br />

                         Make sure the tasks are fun and ridiculously easy to perform. If you are additionally able to overpay them, your lot will become a very popular 'building site' with lots of tiny workers moving all over the place.

                         If you are incapacitated by a chronic illness or disability, or you are an elder who finds it challenging moving around, having little workers at your lot, like this, is a very nice way to go about both legal and illegal child love practice as a pedophile.

                         Your obvious life situation will actually make this method much easier and way more effective to use contrary to those who're not in your situation. By being limited, your requests for help will be very plausible and legitimate, while both children and their parents seem to generally trust invalids and elders more quickly than usual.

                         Invalids and elders will also make the children feel that they are in control most of the time, thus making the children feel very safe and comfortable around them; making it additionally easier for these adults to seduce children and make the children do sexual things with them, contrary to non-invalids.

                                   I once heard a true story about an invalid who had a little helper and friend to help him out with miscellaneous stuff for some money. It was a 7 year old neighbor girl who was allowed by her parents to hang out at his house to help out.
                         
                                   <br />

                                   He wasn't paralyzed, but he had big troubles moving around, and was thus in a wheelchair.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Once, he managed to talk her into washing his genitals, which she happily did out of her own curiosity, and of course because she got some extra money for it.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   Gently and thoroughly, every single day, with soap, water and a sponge, she rubbed and washed his fully erected penis. And he came every single time, to her curious amusement.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   This led to all kinds of sexual games between the two of them, until a year later, when he finally became her very first male, through a vaginal sexual intercourse.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;

                                   And all this wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been invalid.

                         Many people are having a hard time believing me when I say that several invalids and wheelchair users, who both <u>live</u> alone and are <u>bound</u> to their own homes, have actually succeeded with illegal child love practice, with both children girls and children boys at almost all ages, many times.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But it really is true. And sometimes, the invalids can make this happen even quicker and easier than non-invalids, as soon as they find themselves a little friend and <u>worker</u>.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Elders are in a similar position, being kind and seemingly harmless people who need help for trivial everyday tasks, even help to wash their genitals(!).
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Whether being an invalid or elder, you can actually play more helpless than you really are. Many invalids and elders <u>are</u> pretty strong and active, but if they play weak and helpless, they can more easily succeed with this method.

                         Advertising in public for young helpers and workers is the challenging part of this magnet, which can take some work and time to succeed, while unfortunately risking pedophilic suspicions during the process if you're not careful.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus. special care and patience have to be put into this if you want this magnet to become efficient and safe to use.

                         However, and as already mentioned, invalids and elders will less likely fall under pedophilic suspicions in this regard, as their obvious life situations make such requests more plausible and trustworthy, contrary to those who are young and healthy.

                         The first way to go about this, is the direct way, which is advertising work discreetly to the local children in your neighborhood whom you already know at various levels.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is the most efficient way, but also the way that makes this look more like an obvious kiddie magnet than pure and honest work, because you're targeting children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;<a id="link1"></a>
                         <br />
                         
                         To prevent this from seeming like an obvious kiddie magnet, you may want to involve the children's parents:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This may seem like a strange thing to suggest, but it may be better to be open about it than trying to hide it.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         Like, if some parents should one day discover that their children have a <u>secret</u> job over at your lot that pays money, especially inside your home, they will most likely freak out and begin hammering on your door for answers. But, if their children instead come to them <u>first</u> and ask if it's okay that they help you for some money, and that you asked them to ask their parents first, it will immediately seem less suspicious and more legitimate.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If they aren't allowed to do so, then they aren't. You made them ask for permission first, so you did the right thing.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If they are allowed to, you can then feel more assured and comfortable when they're at your place and working, because they got permission from their parent's to do so, thus no surprise visits from angry, concerned and suspicious parents.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And with time, you will get gradually more access and alone time with their children; as the trust between the all of you will only increase with time, which is an automatic psychological phenomena among most parents.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, if you involve <u>several</u> parents within a close proximity of your neighborhood, by asking several kids for work, the parents may start talking <u>together</u> about it, thus you may get an unfortunate reputation; which in the end can make this whole kiddie magnet method fail, by having your whole local community becoming aware of it.

                         <br />
                         
                         The second way to go about this, is the indirect way, which is advertising work for money by putting up stickers and fliers around areas where children usually hang out.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is the least efficient way, but also the way that makes this look less like an obvious kiddie magnet; because your advertisements won't be targeted <u>directly</u> towards children, even though this is what we'll aim for here.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The trick with this approach begins by <u>not</u> mentioning in the ads that you want underage workers, just that you need help in general for either animal care or various home tasks, which of course appears as easy tasks that pay decent money.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />                    
                         
                         If you request help for animal care, add a nice picture of the animal(s) in question, preferably a high resolution print with colors. This will more easily attract a child's attention, while making the ads look more safe and trusty.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The most efficient advertisements have a header that says "Need money?". And then write some about the tasks and salary underneath the header.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then we get to the contact info, which is a part of our trick, which is to <u>never</u> enter your home address nor your listed phone number on any of your ads. The only contact info in your ads should be an unlisted or secret phone number, ideally a phone number to an anonymous and prepaid cellphone that isn't <u>initially</u> linked to your address.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Now, you will only receive phone calls from people whom <u>initially</u> don't know who you are, thus making you able to anonymously and comfortably distinguish adults and general weirdos <u>from</u> those thin and sweet voices of genuine, innocent and helpful children in (desperate) need of money.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is so convenient, because you can put up as many ads as you want to, and just wait for the phone to start ringing. And from there, sort the right ones from the wrong ones.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         When the 'kids' start calling you, be very careful about whom you choose to invite to your real address. This can actually become some challenging for newbies and inexperienced pedophiles who've never done this before, especially if not having interacted with children all that much.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         One way to authenticate a real child is to ask for the child's surname; and if the 'child' hesitates, it is most likely phony. Also ask for the child's age, and see if that causes any hesitations as well; and just try to judge if the child <u>really</u> sounds as young as it claims to be, while talking together.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         After having talked together some, and you feel that <u>this</u> might be a real child calling to work for you, tell the child that you will call it back, and ask for its phone number if the caller ID didn't show up when the child called you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Then try tracking the child's phone number to learn who really owns the phone, where the owner lives, and etc, to further authenticate the caller. If the number can't be tracked, you should be careful about going any further with <u>that</u> caller.

                         Please note that the child's phone number may be registered to one of its parents.

                         Now, let's take a look at some neat places where your ads should be hung up to attract children:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         <span class="sub4">Public Message Boards</span>
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Public message boards can be found around shopping malls, fast food restaurants, kiosks, and places where kids and adolescents tend to hang out.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         These are definitely the safest places to advertise for children workers, as you won't be targeting them apparently, thus not attract any immediate pedophilic suspicions.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Unfortunately, these boards are not seen by everyone, as only a minority looks at them. And several of those who do, can be both adults and some really strange characters.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It may therefore take some time before any real children see your advertisements and contact you, which is the price you'll have to pay for choosing the <u>safest</u> option.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Many children travel to school with school buses. And these buses stop at various bus stops on the way to and from school. By putting up your advertisements at these bus stops, where all these curious children wait for the school bus in boredom, they can easily notice your ads.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But so can everyone else, including the bus drivers, who can become very protective towards the children, thus making it more suspicious and risky using <u>such</u> spots.

                         This <u>is</u> however a really effective way to advertise for children workers, even children as young as first-graders.

                         Some <u>very</u> efficient places to advertise at, are playgrounds and special spots where children <u>regularly</u> hang out.

                         <br />
                         
                         But now it becomes even more suspicious and risky if some observant or paranoid adult sees the ads, as you're now targeting children for <u>real</u>.

                         It helps however to set up the ads in a way so that people who pass by these locations don't see them that easily, while the kids who're playing there more easily do.

                         If you're able to locate paths and routes that you <u>know</u> children use regularly, and ideally children at most, such as dedicated paths and routes to local schools, you may also consider putting up your ads along these paths, like on trees, which makes them easily noticeable when the kids pass by.

                         While not being illegal by law in most parts of the world to advertise for helpers and workers, which is initially legitimate and something that many people generally do, you may still risk becoming a suspect of luring kids to your home.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This risk will first of all depend on <u>where</u> you advertise, as we have recently and already gone through.

                         <br />
                         
                         It will further depend on your own life situation and social status; as it is far less suspicious doing this if you already have children, or at least an adult partner, contrary to being a single male and loner in your community.

                         If your community is pretty large, you may be able to do this without too many noticing it nor caring too much about it. If your community is pretty small and tight, you will much easier gain unwanted attraction, rumors and suspicions. If pedophiles have been caught there earlier in recent history, most people will be very aware about this in general.

                         You may have the children keep your work arrangements as secrets, but that may backfire horribly, as already <a class="set3" href="#link1" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in the direct advertisement approach.

                         What sort of tasks you advertise will also become important factors; like animal care and lawn mowing will be far less suspicious than e.g. indoor vacuum cleaning; especially if you're a young and healthy male.

                         Many pedophiles turn their lots into small amusement parks instead of creating animal farms.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Amusement park props do obviously not require the same sort of care and maintenance as animals do, making them great alternatives for those who want to create more or less maintenance-free kiddie magnet properties; but <u>still</u> attracting children almost as efficient as animal farms do.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Though, amusement park props are expensive and they require some space. So, this magnet is first of all for those who have a medium to large wallet or credit card, and a medium to large backyard to install the props into.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Second, this magnet is listed at third place because it is very suspicious setting up an amusement park that is targeted towards children if you don't have any of your own, nor any children in your family that comes for visits now and then. This magnet is thus more ideal for those who already got children in one way or another, and less ideal for those who don't.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         There are however a couple of ways to setup such props <u>without</u> making it seem too obvious as kiddie magnet:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Invite your neighbors to a party at your house, or invite your work colleges, or any group of people you know. And then buy either one or several of the following recommended props for that party, even when it's an adult party. This is quite common to do and very funny for your drunk guests.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When the party is over, the props will still be there, and thus attract a lot of attention from neighbor kids, who will most likely end up at your doorstep asking to play with them.
                         
                         <br />

                                   I actually know one person who did this. And his party drew a lot of attention when it was live, which actually made some neighbor kids attend at the very party to play with the props.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   And, they where back in his garden early next morning, actually without his permission(!); which really is a great thing.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   No neighbors got any immediate suspicions, as they even came by themselves a few times to have some fun with all the kids. And his garden was pretty much occupied with children from that party and on, during most evenings and weekends.
                                   
                                   <br />
                                   &#160;
                                   <br />
                                   
                                   In other words, this trick became a huge success for that pedophile. He got himself a lot of new contacts and friends, and had lots of 'fun' with some of the kids.
                                                                                
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Another way to avoid kiddie magnet suspicions, is to go for the last recommended prop, which is a super expensive installation, but also a super powerful magnet.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The bottom line is this: whatever you choose to install into your own property is <u>your</u> business only. If you don't care too much about what other people might think, just install whatever you want to.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If someone should ever ask why you have such things in your back garden, you may just tell them that you have some kids far out in your family that visit you now and then.

                         If your backyard is very private, this will obviously be easier to accomplish successfully.

                         Air castles are probably the cheapest props to get, and they come in many different sizes. The largest ones are obviously the most funny and attractive among children.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         They are extremely popular in general, among most children at most ages, and will attract them like flies to a flypaper.

                         A nice thing about air castles is that they are kind of private, making it easier for a pedophile to be more intimate with the neighbor kids while being <u>inside</u> them; like throwing them around, tackling them and tickling them, and being very physical without it being easily seen from the outside.

                         Another nice thing about them is that you can inflate and deflate them whenever you want to, so they don't have to take up so much space after all.

                         Air sliders are similar to air castles, but are meant for sliding instead. Some of them can become pretty large and expensive, and even have water pools to slide into. Most are quite big in general, and will thus require a decently sized backyard, with some elevation, to be successfully hosted.

                         They are almost just as popular among children as the air castles are, thus attract most children at most ages; while also being able to inflate and deflate to save space.

                         Trampolines are very popular among children. Though, this has become a pretty usual prop for many families to have in their back yards, so a lot of kids already have them.

                         But, and as with the other props on the list, they <u>do</u> come in different sizes. So, if you get one that's <u>very</u> large, it may attract even those kids who already have smaller ones.

                         Just be careful so that your trampoline has all the recommended security add-ons and features, as they can become pretty dangerous. If a child hurts itself on your trampoline, your garden will suddenly attract a lot of attention. You may even get a big lawsuit.

                         There are <u>tons</u> of accessories for swimming pools, like diving boards, sliders, inflatable water props, and many toys, turning your backyard into a water fun land for your neighbor kids.

                         They can even be installed with heaters, so they can be used during cold winters. Imagine having half nude children in your backyard in the middle of a cold winter! And if <u>that</u> doesn't make your lot popular among the children, then nothing will.

                         And another huge advantage with swimming pools is that <u>anyone</u> can build them <u>without</u> becoming suspects for attracting children.

                         <br />
                         
                         The drawback? Well, the <u>cost</u> of building one! Which, leaves this magnet at last place.
                         
                         <br />

                         If you want a really nice pool in your backyard, embedded deeply into the ground, with tiles, cleaning system, water heating system, and all those goodies, it will cost a lot. But these pools are also the most popular and attractive ones.
                                             
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Luckily, there are cheaper solutions out there, made by vinyl and plastic, usually circular and can be found in pretty decent sizes, which can actually be just placed on the ground. Or, you can use a shovel and some time to actually embed one into the ground. With some creativity and time, even a cheap pool can turn into a pretty nice and attractive swimming pool.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you live in a pretty poor neighborhood, even the lightest and cheapest vinyl and plastic solutions may actually become enormously popular, as long as they have a decent size.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you build a decent swimming pool in a neighborhood with few to none swimming pools, ideally in a poor community, and that neighborhood contain lots of children, and they learn that they can come over to your lot and swim whenever they want to, you may get lots of half-nude kiddies running around your lot all day and all week long.

                         A not so known trick among pedophiles, that actually goes all the way back the the 50's, is the 'bring me home' trick used with puppies and kittens, but mostly kittens.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is probably not the most efficient way to attract children, but it is <u>enormously</u> easy and usually free of charge.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Get yourself a 6-8 weeks old kitten; as these kittens are most efficient for this method, being so small and obviously helpless, but mature enough to move around some.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Tie a <u>very</u> visible band around the kittens neck, with your home address on it, and simply let the kitten off somewhere away from your home, <u>early</u> in the morning, but still somewhere within your neighborhood.
                                                  
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You should ideally let the kitten off in areas where children usually walk by, hang out, and play. A school yard is an extremely efficient place to let the kitten off at, but also a little bit obvious and suspicious, <u>especially</u> if you repeat it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         So, if a naive child, who's old enough to read, finds this kitten and picks it up, and sees the address, she or he will most likely want to return the kitten to its owner.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Thus through this clever method, you may get several kids on your front door returning your kitten; whom may even fall in love with the little beast and be open for further visits to play and bond with it, which you then may suggest.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This method will most likely attract children within the ages of 7 and 12 approximately, who's capable of reading.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         However, this method has some obvious ethical problems, as  it isn't especially nice to drop off kittens at random locations outdoors, all alone and possibly afraid. The kitten can easily be attacked and eaten by other animals around too, like loose dogs and foxes. Or, it can become just lost, and thus die a slow, painful and lonely death within some bushes.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And of course, you never know <u>who</u> will bring the kitten home, as it can be anyone from a sweet little girl to a stinking homeless who wants money for what he just found.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This method is very old-school, and I only know a few pedophiles who still use it today. But a few of those who do, actually do now and then succeed.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Like, if a little pigtailed sweetie in a summer dress comes to your front door with the kitten in her school backpack, why not ask her if she would like to become the kittens new friend and help you out sometimes? I'm sure that she would love to!
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You may also let off several kittens at once, around in your neighborhood, and increase the odds of getting kids to your door. But this should be done with care, so people won't suspect that something is wrong here.

                         One pedophile once wrote that he got the animal protection service on his back from doing this a whole summer, and had to pay a $500 fine. But he <u>did</u> get <u>one</u> kid on his doorstep!

                         It's a little bit of a pity that as I now write this, Halloween is just over. But I had lots of beautiful kids in various beautiful, scary and funny costumes knocking on my front door.
                         
                         <br />

                         There's nothing like hearing those thin and sweet voices shouting out 'trick or treat', while they look at you with those big and hopeful eyes that are eager for candy. And as soon as you show them the candy bucket, their small hands start crawling all over it like hungry little ants.
                         
                         <br />

                         It's almost like I want to cry out loud right now, thinking that this happens only <u>once</u> a year. How can God be so cruel?!

                         Well, back to reality:

                         Halloween is a celebration that isn't exclusive for the US and Canada anymore, as it became an almost worldwide event about 10 years ago. It is a true gift to pedophiles, and I'm having a hard time seeing it in any other way.
                         
                         <br />

                         <u>One</u> evening per year, your home will be attacked and invaded by sweet little witches, fairies and anything you can imagine giving a pedophile a boner, asking for candy. And that event is something that you should <u>not</u> let pass by without at least <u>trying</u> to exploit it.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Well, I do got a trick for you that you can use, which few to no parents out there have though of as a potential danger:
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         First of all, you will need to make your home shine like a Christmas tree with Halloween adornments. Make astronauts able to see it from the international space station if possible. The idea here is to make your home <u>inviting</u>, so all the kids who pass by will just <u>know</u> that this house has <u>lots</u> of candy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And candy it should have! Because when they ring on your doorbell, have the largest imaginable basked, or and empty oil barrel for that matter, filled with lots of nice candy that shines and sparkles in all imaginable colors. Have even several containers, and so much candy that it almost gets ridiculous.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         It's important that these containers are a little bit inside your home, so the children will have to get some inside it to grab the candy. The reason for this will be explained further down.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         No, we won't be doing what the stupid pedophiles are doing: trying to molest the kids while being in their Halloween costumes. This is also what most stupid parents think will happen as well. No offense, but this is just stupid, even though it would've been nice having a fairy with wings giving you head in the doorway.

                         The trick here is to actually make them <u>return</u> another day! And you will try accomplishing that by saying:
                         
                         <br />

                                   "Shit! I think I've bough a little bit too much candy this year. You may want to come back another day without your costumes and grab some more, or else I'll have to throw it away."
                         
                              </div>
                              
                         </div>
                         
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will of course encourage the children to grab more than usual, and even return several times during that same evening, but you will of course have a backup storage to refill the container <u>if</u> they return another day, as planned.
                         
                         <br />

                         Believe me, the kids <u>will</u> return, some even the very next day. Every single pedophile to my knowledge who've used this Halloween trick, have been revisited by children.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         However, it's important that you <u>only</u> tell this to the candidates whom you would like to see returning another day.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         The reason for having the candy a little bit inside your door, is because some children are accompanied by their parents, unfortunately. And you must do whatever you can to be able to tell the children this without their parents being too close by and listening. This can become hard to accomplish, but you must do whatever possible. Just make sure that the door is open and that the kids are still visible, to some extent, while grabbing candy from your silo.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most preschoolers are usually accompanied by their parents. The early elementary schoolers are usually accompanied as well, but some have their parents wait for them at a certain distance, as they really want to do this all by their own. Most 9 year olds and older should come all alone.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         When the children return another day for more candy, you will exploit that to make them return even more; like telling them that you know someone whom works at a candy fabric, whom gives you lots of candy, so they can stop by now and then for even more. Or, you may of course combine this Halloween trick with any other magnet in this guide.

                         Having a free candy store in the neighborhood can attract a lot of children all year long. And if that rumor spreads, don't become surprised if you one day get a lonely 4 year old on your door, standing there with two big eyes and a smile:
                         
                         <br />

                         <div class="quote_child">
                         
                              <div class="text">
                    
                                   "Do you have some candy, sir?"
                         
                              </div>

                         <br />
                    
                         This method is <u>very</u> efficient, but it works only <u>once</u> a year. Thus, when next Halloween approaches, make sure you have all this carefully planned and prepared.

                         Thank you so much, whoever came up with the idea of having children dress up in sexy and hot costumes, and knocking on random doors all over. That person must either be a pedophile himself, or the stupidest person on the planet.

                         One problem with outside and backyard kiddie magnets is that they can quickly seem suspicious in other peoples eyes if you're not careful. Thus, any outside projects of such can quickly become restricted, especially if you're a lonely male.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         What you keep indoors though, is no one else's business. Thus, the potential of <u>this</u> method is only limited by your physical indoor space and the size of your wallet.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         This method is all about turning your home into a toy heaven, by creating a very large and powerful kiddie magnet for any gender and age, with lots of expensive toys that most kids don't have access to for obvious reasons.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you really want to go to town with this method, create a large toy store inside your home, like a miniature Toys 'r Us, with dolls that little girls can pick up and play with, or cool masculine toys for boys to fiddle, build and play with.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The possibilities are really endless with this method!
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         But, even just a few handpicked, popular and expensive toys will actually be enough for most pedophiles to make this method a huge success.
                                        
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Most pedophiles who choose to use this magnet, dedicate a medium sized room for their toy heaven. It can be in your basement or up in the attic, as in creating a nice and attractive playroom for the neighborhood kiddies to play in whenever they want to, and as much as they want to.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The master challenge with this method is of course to get the children <u>inside</u> your home, just as we've recently been into regarding indoor animals for your animal farm. But a toy heaven gets even more difficult to advertise, as it <u>really</u> is an obvious kiddie magnet, especially if you don't have kids.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This also means that this method will be considerably risky even if you do succeed getting children indoors, as they may tell about it here and there, which may concern or even get some parents to react.
                                                                 
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This is why this kiddie magnet is the very last one of them all, but still very effective if you're very careful and slick.

                         One way of making this method a success is to combine it with any of the others, even with Halloween, meaning any magnet that lures children either to your backyard or to your front door. That will make this method very successful.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;

                         If you already know a local kid, you can discreetly invite her or him to see your play room.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         The child in question doesn't <u>have</u> to be your main candidate, or any candidate at all. You only need to start a rumor in the neighborhood that you have this unique playroom.
                         
                         <br />

                         Always have some nice toys in the trunk of your car, parked outside your home. And as soon as you see children play somewhere near your car, you can go outside and take out all those cool toys from the trunk while the children see it, and carry it all into the house. Hopefully you'll draw their attention and curiosity enough for them to contact you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You can also do this in reverse, like carrying empty boxes from your cool stuff either back into your car or place them around your trash bin in plain view. This may also grab the kids attention in a similar way, so they will contact you.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you are ever outside in your garden, and there are some children nearby, and nearby enough so you can talk together from your lot without having to approach them, you could easily initiate a conversation about toys. Ask them if they know about this cool new toy or that cool new doll that can do so many cool things. That will make most children very interested. You may then tell them that you actually have it inside, as long as the coast is clear and they can come along with you inside without it looking suspicious.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And regarding Halloween, some pedophiles place either the toys or the empty boxes of the toys in they hallways as the children come for candy. Any observant kid may comment the toys, and then you can just tell them to stop by one day and play with them, if they want to.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         Optionally, and as already <a class="set3" href="#link1" target="_blank">covered</a> with children working at your lot for money, you will now as well have the choice of either making the children keep this toy heaven of yours a secret, meaning secret visits, or tell the children to ask their parents for permission before they can come inside and play.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This will always be a difficult decision to make, as it is hard to predict with any certainty what either outcome will be like.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If you haven't overdone this playroom, and you at least invent a child in your family whom visits you now and then, which is why you've built it, having the neighbor children ask for their parents permission to be there may be the best thing to do.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If your playroom is way too obvious as a kiddie magnet, the parents may become concerned and look at you as a potential pedophile who wants to lure children to a special play room, thus keeping it a secret becoming a better option.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         But keeping it a secret may also backfire; all of which make this magnet so challenging and difficult to use, especially for inexperienced pedophiles.

                         <br />
                         
                         However, most children will be quite motivated to keep this room a secret anyway, to be able to <u>continue</u> using it.

                         Creating an <u>aesthetic</u> environment is very important to make the room as attractive as possible. As soon as the children enter the room, they will have to be blown away at once; and want to stay there forever and never want to leave.

                         Most pedophiles are into either girls or boys, and want to stick to a certain age group.

                         Thus, if you're into e.g. first-grade girls, or somewhere around that age, make sure the room is awesomely feminine. It should be pink, contain all the coolest and most expensive toys and dolls for that age group, even a makeup studio, so the children almost get high by just being in the room.
                         
                         <br />

                         And the same with boys; create a masculine environment with lots of electronics, large drivable cars, things than can be built and modified, the latest and greatest game consoles with the latest and greatest games, add-ons, and so forth.

                         It's generally wise to talk to professionals regarding play room design and toys, so you know what kind of room an e.g. 6 year old little girl would love to be in, and what toys that are the hippest and coolest for your actual gender and age.

                         Even though it is not a magnet all by its own, it can be generally important to just make yourself seen outside your home or in your garden doing various stuff. Children are very curious and contact seeking by nature, so by just being <u>visible</u> outdoors may actually be enough to attract some children; especially the very open, lonely or friend seeking.

                                   Actually, I have a few times been approached by curious children outside my own home while doing special things. They usually ask me what I'm doing, and usually end up helping me.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   One time, I got help from a 4 year old girl to paint my front door. Another time I got help from a 6 year old girl to wash my car. And some of my neighbors though it was cute that the children helped me, and that I gave them attention.
                                   
                                   <br />

                                   And those two children bonded with me when they helped me, which caused them to return later for more chats and activities; especially the 4 year old who got an ice cream for helping me. Now, she knows where to get free ice creams!

                         Thus, engage conversations with them and show them that you're interested in them and their lives. Ask if they want to help you, as doing activities together will build initial bonds and trust that will make them return in the future; especially if you give them sweet treats.

                         It's very important to work some on your neighbors, if you haven't done so already, before creating and using any kiddie magnets. It's important to build trust and confidence with both neighbors and parents, as this will make things much easier and even safer for you when both attracting and interacting with the local children.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         This can become especially important if you already have a child in mind, whom you would like to attract to your property.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         You should then try befriending that family and aim for a friendship with the same gender parent of the selected child. Don't befriend any parents with the opposite gender, as this will usually create jealousy and miscellaneous conflicts.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         And as always, never overdo this. You may quickly become a hassle if the family really don't want any new friendships or they don't like you enough. As soon as you feel that you're in some way trespassing their lives, or they act uncomfortable or phony while being around you, just keep some distance, while still being friendly and nice towards them in general.

                         The perfect way to go about this is to be a helpful neighbor.

                         If the family in question is one day doing something special outside at their property, like building, maintaining or painting something, make contact and ask what sort of project they're working on. Then offer your help, for free of course.
                         
                         <br />

                         This can be a very convenient and natural way of making that first contact, while giving them an exceptional first impression of yourself as a friendly and trusting neighbor.

                         If you notice the neighbor in question having a specific hobby or interest, you may want to adapt to that interest and make yourself <u>seen</u> doing the same thing or using the same equipment. This can make the neighbor actually contact you instead, which will make everything generally easier.

                         If the family isn't working on any special projects outside, neither having any special interest or hobbies that are visible, or you just want to make a very gradual approach, you can start making yourself seen while they are outside.

                         Just try to learn their routines, and then arrange accidental bypasses, which would be a great way to just say 'hello'.

                         With some time and patience, you may start with a simple conversation, like about the weather, and gradually test the waters with deeper and more advanced conversations.

                         When children contact you outside your home or in your garden, be very open and casual when interacting with them. Don't look around you and whisper to the children, or seem secretive or uncomfortable. Just be self-confident and proud, and not afraid of interacting with them. There might be eyes looking towards you, and this will make you seem like a very honest and trustworthy guy that has nothing to hide.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         If the children want to come along with you indoors, either by their own suggestion or by yours, the ideal thing is to ask them to run home and ask their parents about it first. If they want to go inside to look at animals or toys, perform some work for you, especially with a salary, or get an ice cream or anything to drink, by making them ask their parents about it first, will make their parents feel safe and comfortable towards you, as you'll then appear as an honest and childproof person who don't try to get their children indoors in secrecy.
                         
                         <br />
                         &#160;
                         <br />
                         
                         Of course, there might be special circumstances that would make you prefer getting them indoors in complete secrecy, but this should be done with special care and only as a last resort to fulfill your intentions.
                         
                         <br />

                         <br />
                         
                         It's also important that when you finally get a child inside your home for the first time, always have your front door wide open during the first visits. If any other neighbor should see a child come along with you inside your home, or if the child's parents should look for their children and see what you're doing, it will look very honest and ethical of you to have the front door open for them to either peak inside or walk through.

                         Only close and lock doors when you're (pretty) sure that no other neighbors see it, and when you've acquired enough trust from their parents and/or feel safe enough to actually start fiddling with the child, as in playing <u>secret</u> games.
